Join the discussion for King Lear:
* How realistic or believable is Lear’s hamartia? And just a hint – the harmatia is a bit more complicated than “pride.” Pride is the basis for a lot of character flaws. So look for a more specific flaw for Lear.
* What are your impressions of the “children” after Act I?
* Is Gloucester’s harmatia the same as Lear’s?
* Any good quotes? Why do you like them?
* Add your own discussion topics or questions to the string – if someone asks a question, can you answer it? I will later, but we will see what you know and understand first.


King Lear’s hamartia is his overwhelming need for others to proclaim their admiration of him, as well as his rash nature that compels him to do things like banishing Cordelia. The first notion of King Lear’s character comes in the very beginning of the play, where he demands his daughters to contest additional territory by showing how much they love him. What happens, rather, is that words take precedence over actual love in the two elder daughters, Goneril and Regan. 


In many of the scenes, King Lear’s emotions dominate his actions and banishes those who are truly loyal, as although they (Cordelia and Kent) were truly loyal to him, they had failed to capture his emotions. King Lear only realizes this after the two elder sisters have taken advantage of his malleable nature, and regret and heartbreak overwhelm him into insanity. 


The theme of valuing the smallest things even in prosperous times appears multiple times in the story, and this is perhaps a flaw of King Lear too—the fact that he only values what is said presently rather than what is done over a long time. 


King Lear’s children, with the exception of Cordelia, are greedy and disloyal, both to their husbands and father. This behaviour cannot be framed and attributed to their antagonistic nature, however, as one could argue Lear had acted in the same manner towards his own daughter, and likewise, his two daughters would act the same towards him when they had more power. 


One also gets a sense of how blind Lear is to long lasting loyalty and love in lieu of a few words and praises.
