The Olympics Opening Ceremony is really awesome and cool. However, what you do not know is that there could be glitches and technical difficulties at any time during the ceremony. For example, in the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics Ceremony, only four of five floating rings expanded. If you did not know the plan for the Opening Ceremony, it is five of the rings explode, or expand, at the same time. Also, what I mean by floating is the Olympic rings are held by strings that are almost invisible to the naked human eye. Anyways, as a result of the glitch in the olympics opening ceremony, the International Olympic Committee defends the act of rehearsing the ceremony on television or any other broadcasting devices. 


Many members of the International Olympics Committee defended the act of broadcasting the glitch in the Olympics Opening Ceremony. The five Olympic rings were supposed to expand, and explode all at the same time as if it had been a fireworks show. Also, another bad thing that happened was when an Olympics Opening Ceremony torch holder tweeted an insult about President Barack Obama of the United States. As a result of the glitch in the Olympics Opening Ceremony, the russian state television cut the part where the fifth ring did not expand and explode. Instead, the Russian State TV inserted the recorded images of what was supposed to happen. However, not all of the broadcasting stations in Russia and around the world used that video footage.
