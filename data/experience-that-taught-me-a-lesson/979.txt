An Experience That Taught Me a Lesson
Through the years, I have been warned countless times about not finishing drinks and juices overnight, as they may become inedible when not refrigerated overnight. When my parents scolded me, I just listened with only a part of my attention focused. My parents call this “going in one ear and out the other, just like wind”. I think this meant that I only perceived it for a little amount of time until I forgot it. Anyways, they kept on saying warnings while I kept on listening and forgetting, but the last time that I forgot, my parents decided to try something new: whipping. 
As I was eating breakfast, preparing to go to school, my dad found the half-full coconut water can that I had drank last night. Suddenly, he shook his head and took a stick. I realized with horror that he was going to spank me! And then, the stick hit with not much speed, but taught me a lesson that I will, probably, never forget again.
