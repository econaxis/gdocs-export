Hydraulic Fracking is a great way to obtain valuable natural resources that lies within the Earth. Even though government groups support Fracking and it is a very effective way to collect the natural resources, it has done a great damage to the environment. 
Fracking is commonly known as sending water along with other chemicals at high pressure into a wellbore, a small tunnel used for the purpose of exploring or fracking. The high pressured water then fractures the rock in the Earth and continues down the wellbore. Some people are against it because it uses a lot of water to fracture the rocks beneath the Earth, and also destroy the wildlife there, creating such a huge mess. Fracking accounts for seventy percent of all the natural gas, coal, and oil that the United States uses. Fracking is also used for pre-conditioning the ground rocks before mining, making mining easier. 
Water comes in as clean, but comes out as dirty, so injecting that dirty water that had gone down the drain underground is a great way to get rid of it, but there are some disadvantages too. Yes, we got rid of the waste water; however, those waters will pollute the rocks, and will eventually travel to the trees, and uproot them. 
Do not think that the water that they use in the process of fracking is safe; it is mixed with thousands of other chemicals, to make it fracture rock with more force, such as acid. In fact, over a thousand of chemicals are added inside the water; actually, it uses 1 to 8 million gallons of water per fracture, and 40,000 gallons of chemicals per fracture.
