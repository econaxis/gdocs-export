Write more, do everything less


I had the good opportunity over winter break to work as a volunteer in a writing/journalism course for 9-12 year olds. 


The problem with language instruction nowadays:
Too much teaching, and too little writing.
Writing is different from math or science: there is almost nothing to teach once you get past the alphabet. English has 26 trivial characters you need to teach: everything else is just a rearrangement of these characters to either produce a kindergartener’s first attempt at writing to a Shakespeare masterpiece. 


Describe volunteer experience—how little we did writing and how so much of my role was to make sure the kids behaved. 
In fact, about half of the activities, I think, were more to keep the kids engaged on busy work that had little do with writing. 


My experience was not limited to just this class: all of my English classes at school had been somewhat like this. While I understand English class at school is supposed to cover areas outside writing, like literary analysis and speaking, there is still too little emphasis on just good, solid writing time. 


(Calculate how many total words written over one year).


Pure, simple writing has fallen culprit to the new wave of supposed ‘21st century education principles,’ which, in a nutshell, deem that the more complicated, the more expensive, and the more education buzzwords it entails, the more effective the activity. Bonus points if it is a group-based activity.


While I don’t dare to denounce these principles on STEM subjects, its effectiveness on things that can’t be teached like writing is questionable. 


Often times, what is simple works the best. In this case, just 40 minutes of undisturbed writing, for, say, every week, is simple for both the student and the teacher: no complicated project-based holistic differentiated approaches needed.
