Vancouver is surrounded on one side by ocean and the other by mountain, right beside a world class university. Whistler, dubbed as the best ski resort in North America, is only 2 hours away from downtown Vancouver. 
        Instead of dwelling on the tourist hotspots of Vancouver, let's look instead at the numerous abandoned, tear-down houses in Vancouver. These houses often have unmowed lawns, overgrown bushes, and boarded-up windows. They are often subject to vandalism and crime, scarring an otherwise normal neighborhood. That is not the important problem of Vancouver, however. Every neighborhood has one of those derelict houses. To try to solve them would be pointless. The real problem is in the houses’ price tag: 2.2 million dollars.
        The blasted housing situation in Vancouver has prompted 2 new taxes purposed to lower foreign demand for Vancouver housing and coerce homeowners to rent their vacant homes. One of them, the Empty Homes Tax, charges homeowners 1% of the value of the house for having empty homes (uninhabited for 180 days per year). The only way out? To rent the property. 
        It seems this new tax is the perfect solution to the housing crisis, directly up new rental supply to relieve demand. This, I fear, is the wrong solution.
        If I was the mayor of Vancouver, I would opt for a more indirect solution that targets the multitude of factors culminating to the current housing market.

   * Foreign buyer’s tax
   * Empty homes tax (detailed)
* Why it won’t work
   * The people who own second or third homes in Vancouver are rich, and rich people don’t buy low-end affordable homes. They buy luxurious homes unreachable to middle-classed locals. Of course, with the recent empty homes tax, these properties will likely be rented out. But not to the locals, the people that this tax was supposed to benefit.
