There are some kids in the shelter who mindlessly anticipate the 200 and some dollars they get from Income Assistance[1] every month. There are others who blankly stare across the street to shoppers holding bags full of Thanksgiving decorations. But it doesn’t have to be like this. You can make their Thanksgivings better by donating. Tu Bi Am charity will be buying gifts for these kids from your generous donations to help them experience Thanksgiving in the best way possible: with full stomachs and beaming faces.


Under the previous name of Ni Vien Lien Hoa Temple, Tu Bi Am charity has provided food, supplies, and clothing for 100 ethnic M’Nong families. We have also donated over $800 CAD to Da Nang Oncology hospital and our representatives have helped doctors treat patients. In 2016, we helped orphans and gifted food, books, pens, paper, and essential supplies to Quang Chau temple in Da Nang. We donated $1000 CAD to the Red Cross to support Nepal Earthquake relief from your donations. During the Alberta wildfires in March 2016, we garnered $2000 CAD from donations to support those affected. Now, we are asking you to support our latest endeavour: to make Thanksgiving as best as possible for homeless youth in Vancouver.


We also ask you consider donating on a monthly basis to support our future projects. For $10 monthly, you could build a bridge to improve access to wells, or fund a child’s education for a year, or support a community by giving them ample food. Whatever the amount, know that 100% of your money goes to the people in need.
