HUNG
=====================
Staying at a friend’s house
A special secret place
Telling about a good thing you had done
What if we suddenly had to move?
My most embarrassing moment
Telling about one time you made mistake (not finish homework, tell a lie)
A teacher who you like
Talk about being scared!
Do I want to be famous?
What if I were a teacher?
I’ll never eat another . . .
My biggest surprise
This school really needs . . .
The first day of school is the worst/best.
DUC
========================
Doing homework
A song that means a lot to me
A memory when you were young that you never forget
A good person you know (helping others, hard study ...)
My best day
A day in the life of my pet
I don’t understand why . . .Dirt bikes and in-line skates
A visit to a friend’s school
What is important to me?
A terrible storm
Me and the outdoors
My first school memories
=====================
DUC
What’s good about hard work?
A cool store
My favorite singer(s)
Rights that kids in my grade should have
What a house of the future will look like
My participation in an outside-of-school activity
How I picture myself four years from now
Can farmers grow enough food for everyone?
The worst food I ever ate
Summer in a cabin by a lake
We couldn’t stop laughing!
The book that got me hooked on reading
One thing I want to do by the time I finish 8th grade
I would like to have lived during this time in history.
