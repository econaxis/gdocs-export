November 1st, 8:00 AM
“Officials say at least 11 are injured in a terrorist attack near a Manhattan bike path yesterday noon. We are still…” 
I carefully opened 1 eye, quickly shutting it the second after as the room was too bright. Ugh. I searched for the alarm clock through my stuck eyelids, not wanting to hear the mindless banter of the radio person anymore. I didn’t need any terrorist attack in the morning. And also, Vancouver was at least, like, 4000 miles away from Manhattan. 


I went about with my morning routine without any more mentions of the supposed “attack.” They were commonplace in the news—open up the front page of any mainstream news website and there will always be a gruesome picture, followed by the bold headlines “X Killed in ‘Attack of Terror’,” as if the quotes around ‘Attack of Terror’ was supposed to make me feel better. 


I went into my car, and again, the radio slowly replaced the engine’s whirring noise. 
“The suspect’s name is Sayfullo Saipov, and the police has, indeed, confirmed he is of Bangladeshi descent.” Again. I scrolled across the channels whilst maneuvering my car out of the tight driveway. I wanted to hear sports, science, tech, even some boring economics commentary would have warranted right now. Anything except the man and whatever he had done in a city 4000 miles away. Even the Canadian radio networks were broadcasting about this guy in Queens!
