Are our memories central to our progress or do they limit us?


In my opinion, memories are the backbone of our minds and our society. Without memories, our complex and versatile minds will be idle, incompetent at handling the complex tasks that requires a lot of memory. Our ability to recall different events and influence our decisions based on that is extremely important, and we cannot afford to lose that ability without extremely limiting our brainpower also.
        Our memories enable us to function as we are today: complex, intelligent, and adaptable creatures. However, without them, we would be limited, and we cannot develop further as humans, such as technology.
