Are our memories central to our progress or do they limit us?


In my opinion, memories are the backbone of our minds and our society. Without memories, our complex and versatile minds will be idle, incompetent at handling the complex tasks that requires a lot of memory. Our ability to recall different events and influence our decisions based on that is extremely important, and we cannot afford to lose that ability without extremely limiting our brainpower also.
        Our memories enable us to function as we are today: complex, intelligent, and adaptable creatures. However, without them, we would be limited, and we cannot develop further as humans, such as technology. Memories also prevent us from doing the things that we have failed, and that is very helpful to the further development of humans.Without memories, we and the scientific/discovery community will be in vain, as they replicate the mistakes made by men thousands of years earlier. Our memories enable us to not make those mistakes and make new ones.
