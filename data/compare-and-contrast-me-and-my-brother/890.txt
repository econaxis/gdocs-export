I and My Brother
        We both dislike certain foods; like tennis, chess, and badminton; and almost always lose things that are not attached to our bodies such as keys. Ever since we came to Canada in 2010, my brother disliked the Vietnamese dumplings that our mother usually made. A few years later, I also started to dislike the Vietnamese food. Although I used to like the food very much, after a day of eating a ton of those dumplings, I got sick of it. In addition, we both like to play tennis, chess, and badminton. Whenever we have free time, I would go to the tennis courts to play tennis, or play chess if it is raining outside. We also have a habit of losing things such as keys to our house. 
        Despite these similarities, we still have some differences such as the foods that we like/dislike, our strengths and weaknesses, where we study, and our size. Although my brother dislikes bun bo, it is my favorite food so far.
