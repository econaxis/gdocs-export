The poem reads, “I chase spiders out of/my eyelids./Want to leave,/confess/mistake and anger to/a beast in my gut,/sometimes/in the morning/It/watches me while/I chase spiders out of/…”


This poem has connections that form, eventually, a cycle that lead back towards the original line. I chose to do this because ending it at “a beast in my gut” would not represent how invasive that beast really was to Melinda. It wasn’t simply just a beast that appeared once everyoften in a nightmare—it was a living thing that haunted her every second she tried to speak and every second she held quiet. 


The other parts of the poem are self-explanatory and show all that Melinda suffers. Spiders crawling around in her eyelids are a hyperbole to how deranged and pessimistic her view of the world is, and perhaps also a reference to her fragile state of mind. 


While it is uncommon to confess to a beast in your gut, that is really what Melinda is doing—confessing and keeping all her troubles to herself. She doesn’t confess to anybody else except the beast in her gut, in other words, herself. The cycle then repeats again with the beast encouraging her to be more cynical.
