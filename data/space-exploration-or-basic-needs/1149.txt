Many governments spend their money on building their country’s infrastructure or exploration, most of which are space exploration because many other countries are focusing on space exploration as well. For instance, Russia is going to send out a space probe that will land on a comet, take pictures of it, and send it back to Earth for scientists and astronomers. However, I think most rich governments bother too much on space exploration that they forget how many people are without shelter and food in their country. Still, there are some people left without shelter and food in certain parts of the world, including rich countries like the United States and Canada. Still, the government cannot help all the people in their country, but they can get less people to be so helpless. Anyways, I will talk about whether governments should spend their money on basic needs-shelter, food, water- or space exploration. 

Humans have discovered and wondered many of space’s secrets, and today’s astronomers are ready to reveal them to the world. Governments are building spaceships to do jobs, and each job should uncover secrets of space that we have never known before.
