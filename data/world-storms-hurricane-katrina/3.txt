World storms and hurricanes are always bad, but some of the strongest ones are worst. Most storms not only leave people dying and injured, but they also destroy the city’s man-made or natural-made structures. I have this feeling, when there is gross stuff on the ground or anything that feels gross, like the floor of a bathroom, I avoid stepping on it, especially if it is sandy.
Hurricane Katrina was the largest and third strongest hurricane ever to be recorded to make landfall in the United States. In addition, the damage would have been less if the levees in New Orleans had been built for Category five conditions. The winds in Hurricane Katrina had been so strong that the winds speeds peaked up to one hundred and seventy five miles per hour. The hurricane was so strong that it had a strong surge of up to twenty feet, six meters, high! In fact, Hurricane Katrina affected so much people that 705 were reported as missing. Not only that it made seven hundred and five people lost, but it also affected 15 million people in many different way and factors such as economy, evacuations, gas prices, or drinking water. The final death toll was one thousand eight hundred and thirty six people
An estimated eighty percent of New Orleans was under the water, and up to twenty feet deep in places.
