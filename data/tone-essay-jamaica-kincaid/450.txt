Then write an essay analyzing the rhetorical strategies Kincaid employs to convey her attitude toward England.


The essay “On Seeing England for the First Time,” by Jamaica Kincaid, recounts a period in her childhood where everything was dominated by England, “It had written on it… the words ‘Made in England.’ Those words ‘Made in England’ were written on the box the oats came in too.” Kincaid uses deceptively simple language to hint at the enormity of the problem caused by the English colonising Antigua. The beginning of this essay provides context for Kincaid’s subsequent anger for England later in her life, as she graduates from the “childish” and naive viewpoint employed in the beginning of the essay.
