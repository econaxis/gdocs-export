Then write an essay analyzing the rhetorical strategies Kincaid employs to convey her attitude toward England.


Kincaid, in her essay “On Seeing England For the First Time,” writes from the perspective of a young schoolgirl whose identity and culture is taken away as her mother country is colonized by England, something she describes as “a special jewel alright, and only special people got to wear it.” As with any young person who experiences a sudden and confusing change of identity, Kincaid merely recounts the consequences of English dominance on her country. In the last few paragraphs, however, her naive description wears off to show Kincaid’s underlying contempt for England after she grew up.


The repetition of the words “England” throughout the whole essay serves not only to give the reader the importance of England in Kincaid’s life, but also gives a sense of the oppression Kincaid felt. The essay starts off with the schoolteacher’s glamorous description of England, something akin to “Jerusalem, the place you will go to when you die but only if you have been good.” Then, Kincaid follows with more descriptions of England and the English people, all with the tone of awe and admiration. Her little interjections between these grand claims of English people, how unfit it was for her father to “wear the wrong hat for a hot climate most of his long life,” and how “no one . . . liked eating so much food so early in the day” seem even to be sandwiched between more claims of England. The oppressed tone this repetition of the idea of England suggests of her later repugnance to England once she had grown up, even commenting that England was in “everything else that surrounded us, the exceptions being the sea, the sky, and the air we breathed.” 


Kincaid’s vivid imagery used to describe the scenes adds to the sense of admiration for England.
