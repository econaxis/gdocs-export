Have you ever thought that governments share some surprisingly similar qualities with homeless people! However, they also certainly have differences that make them a different type of people. 
Having goals, having strengths, having weaknesses, and living a life are all common qualities that both presidents and homeless people share. Both governments and homeless people have goals to accomplish. Governments may have goals such as minimizing poverty, improving education for the country, or winning a war against another country. Likewise, a homeless person’s goals may be to get richer, get a house, or just have a better life. Furthermore, they are both a living thing. A government and a homeless person is living. In addition, both types of people have strengths and weaknesses. 
Despite those similarities, governments and homeless people obviously and certainly have great differences. First, a government has different skills than a homeless person. Those skills include public speaking, decision making, and executing plans whereas a homeless person may be good at surviving all types of weather, living in a poor state, or just spending money wisely. In addition, a government will own more things than a homeless person, who probably owns not many things. Furthermore, a government’s voice has more power and persuasion than a homeless person’s voice. People also treat a government differently than they treat a homeless person. Passerbies may feel sorry for a homeless person while feeling inspired, admired, and amazed when they see a homeless person on the street.
