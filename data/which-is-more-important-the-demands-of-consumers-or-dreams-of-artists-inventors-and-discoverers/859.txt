There are many ways in which society is affected by many different types of people:some of them are consumers-the ones who use, and some of them are creators-the ones who create. With this sprouts and erupts and creates the question, which is more important and which more defines a certain society. This also reminds me of the question whether the chicken or the egg comes first. I firstly believe that the people who create are the ones that are really defining society, because without them, each and all types of societies around the world will be the same:without innovation, just using and staying in the comfort zone that we already in already.
First, if there are no inventors or discoverers in this world, there would be no demand for new stuff, and there will always be old stuff around the society. People will not have the nerves and will not have the will and will not have enough bravery to go out and innovate for new stuff. In today’s world, however, we are all trying to educate and get new stuff that has not been ever discovered before. One example of an innovator and discoverer and inventor is Bill Gates. He helped to familiarise people with the idea of “software” and “hardware.” Without him, we would not get the fast computers and reliable computers we all have today. 
The ones who use, the ones who settle, and most of all, the ones who do the things that have already been done do not define society today. This is because if all of the societies are to be composed of entirely of users and consumers, then all of them would be virtually and theoretically the same, because then all of them would have the same technologies and knowledge, and they will never get out of that infinite cycle unless a new inventor who not only uses, but also innovates is born into this world.
