There are many ways in which society is affected by many different types of people:some of them are consumers-the ones who use, and some of them are creators-the ones who create. With this sprouts and erupts and creates the question, which is more important and which more defines a certain society. This also -i don’t know why- reminds me of the question whether the chicken or the egg comes first. I firstly believe that the people who create are the ones that are really defining society, because without them, each and all types of societies around the world will be the same:without innovation, just using and staying in the comfort zone that we already in already.
