Went into the supermarket, saw terrorist attack
Went into a coffee shop, saw terrorist attack,
Hear terrorist attack on the radio
At home, hear terrorist attack


Why all this emphasis? Why put so much emphasis on an attack that killed 32 people, when 13 thousand and some are killed per year due to guns? Why have their deaths not seen a single minute of television screen time?


Amid the green bananas and the yellow discount signs in the store, there was a small TV, the kind with a small screen and a thick body that you would see at your grandparent’s house. It was a wonder that the TV here was still working. It featured a vague picture of a bombed airport, and I could just make out the captions: “32  DEAD FROM BRUSSELS AIRPORT ATTACK.” Even the antiquity and blurriness of this TV couldn’t dampen the fear that had struck me. 32 dead. Bombing. Terrorists. Islam. Religion of war. Screams. I went through every possible scenario, and all the other things associated with a terrorist attack. Thinking about these things made me even more scared. 


Of course, I had read about the terror paranoia that television creates after such a tragic event. And even though people say that knowing what causes the fear diminishes the fear, I was still scared. I gingerly picked out my bananas and compared the prices of the groceries, but the terror of that attack still stayed at the back of my head. 


I finished shopping and began to enter the long line of cars wanting to exit the parking lot. The silence had allowed my fear to manifest into such weirder creatures, and imagination now took free reign. Could it be my city next? What happened if the car behind was a suicide bomber’s? I looked out from my car windows and examined each pedestrian walking by. One was carrying a plastic bag, full of groceries, probably shopping just like I did.
