Dancing Death
First, it danced around the trees. 
We all knew—but what could we do?
His eyes played the movie
We all had seen before.


The alarm ringed,
Eggs sizzled,
The sun went up...down.
And Death came closer.


We waited—
Talked gibberish—held hands.
Argued—cried—
And Death came closer.


Pretended to sleep,
TICK TOCK of the clock so loud.
Played blind and deaf,
That’s when Death knocked.


We stormed down to confront it,
face to face with Death.
We glared at it, but couldn’t.
It was his face that we were staring at.

Death danced around his limp body—
Then left.


Scooped the leftovers.
No way to know. It oughtahappenoldagetakescareofhimgonejustlikethat 
He knew from the beginning. He watched it dance.










I was too busy to greet Death properly.
Busy when he knocked suddenly. 
Opened the door and stepped in. 
I wasn’t ready—
There was never enough time.


Went through dark gates,
Emerged in a world where
People walked backwards, 
Stopped backwards, neatly
Stacking just before the intersection.


I saw me. 
Black hairs took over
Grey hairs, growing higher and thicker.
Grown taller, skin tighter. 
Halfway through, the glasses came off forever.


Walked backwards out of school,
Went up the slides and down the ladder.
Fully formed candies emerging out of my mouth,
Into my hands and back into the wrappers.
Ran backwards through the doors, magically opening for me.


Grew smaller again, loss hair.
Parents recovered from depression,
Smiling wildly at the Gynecology ward.
