Dancing Death
First, it danced around the trees. 
We all knew—but what could we do?
His eyes played the movie
We all had seen before.


The alarm ringed,
Eggs sizzled,
The sun went up...down.
And Death came closer.


We waited—
Talked gibberish—held hands.
Argued—cried—
And Death came closer.


Pretended to sleep,
TICK TOCK of the clock so loud.
Played blind and deaf,
That’s when Death knocked.


We stormed down to confront it,
face to face with Death.
We glared at it, but couldn’t.
It was his face that we were staring at.
20
Death danced around his limp body—
Then left.


Scooped the leftovers.
“No way to know. It oughtahappenoldagetakescareofhimgonejustlikethat.’ 
He knew from the beginning. He watched it dance.
