In some works of literature, a character who appears briefly, or does not appear at all, is a significant presence.
Choose a novel or play of literary merit and write an essay in which you show how such a character functions in the work. You may wish to discuss how the character affects action, theme, or the development of other characters. Avoid plot summary.
