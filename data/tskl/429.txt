The poem, “To a Sky-Lark,” by Shelley is an apostrophe to a bird known as the sky-lark, “from Heaven” that “singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.” The poem consists entirely of apostrophes as the speaker describes the bird, “like a star of Heaven,” using imagery with similes and metaphors. 


The format of the poem as primarily an apostrophe complements the topic of the bird’s magnificence. It is so great, but it “art unseen,—but yet I hear thy shrill delight.” Its “shrill delight” reaches the speaker all the way on the ground even though the bird is not visible. Addressing the poem to the bird highlights its absence from the poem, as the admiration is mainly one sided from man. The sky-lark does not realize we exist, while we busy ourselves admiring its similarity to “a high-born maiden/In a place-tower” or “like a rose embowered/In its own green leaves.” Also, the format of the apostrophe suggests we know little about the bird, as all description in the poem is speculative and a hyperbole, and claims “what thou are we know not” (31). This lack of knowledge about the bird is reflected in the apostrophe format of the poem.
