In the stone ages, the Natives had depended on their own knowledge to survive before the Industrial Revolution. Their life had been very hard, and sometimes boring in my perspective, or point of view. It was boring because all you do everyday is hunt, talk, and sleep. Does not that sound boring to you? However, I do not think that they think their life is very boring because they had many wonders, since the very basic stuff that we know now were not discovered by those Stone Age people. Moreover, I think that they had many worries ( tigers eating them, cold, et cetera). 


        I think that nowadays, people mainly depend on technology, not their own strengths to do hard things. One example is cleaning the house. Before vacuums came out, people use brooms and other devices to clean the house. However, that all changed when vacuums came out. They were strong machines that could clean the house in a matter of minutes. However, vacuums also have many advantages.
