Everybody thinks about the future, what will it be like, can we live in another planet, all types of wonders and questions. I have been fascinated by Bill Gates’ house, a futuristic house that relies on some of the world’s best technology. Some of the predictions made by future guessers are correct, some, however, are completely wrong. Today, I am going to talk about what the house of the future will look like.
I have read a book about Bill Gates’ house and how it works. He makes a tour around his house so that people can see it. So in the beginning, Bill Gates give each one of his tourists a chip to put in their pockets or hold it into their hands. If a person comes into a room with their chip, the sensor in the walls detects that a person is in the room and sends it to the computer. The computer then turns the lights on. Even though the process seems complicated, the signals travel to their destinations really fast, almost at the speed of light. However, I do not think that my house of the future will look like that, instead, it will be big, and looks like a giant, futeristic airplane from the outside, and roomy, and the distinct design will make my house survive most of the natural disasters while making my house look cool. Also, the architects that I am working with to make my house will need to be creative, because I want a unique looking house, not like the common kind. The layout of the house and where the doors are placed must be chosen smartly as well because if two doors are too close toether, they might slam into each other.
