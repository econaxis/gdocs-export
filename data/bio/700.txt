Hello all!
I am a 40 year old accountant working for UBC, born in Vietnam but moved to Canada in 2010. While my relatively boring job as an accountant does not entail much writing, I decided the least I could do was spice up my reports. My level of writing is absolutely despicable compared to my colleagues, so thank god that I have a job that doesn’t require me to showcase my writing. 


Instead of shying away from any writing, I thought to clean it up a bit, and perhaps make my writing more interesting—so here I am! Aside from brushing up my writing skills for work, I also want to get more comfortable with the English language. Whenever I tell interesting stories or do presentations, the words come out all slurred or are littered with grammar mistakes. While this is a writing course, I think improvements in my writing will seep through to my other English skills.


This is my first course in Gotham Writers, and I hope after this, my colleagues will actually look forward to reading my reports!
