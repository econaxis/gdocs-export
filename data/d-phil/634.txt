Every night, as I twist and turn in my bed trying to devise a method to sleep, some random things pop up into my head. And while these “random things” are not as useful as the facts needed for my next test, these “deviations” are not necessarily useless—only stuck in the small moment that I happen to think about them. Questions about identity or afterlife, or perhaps even the classical, the purpose of life, had always visited my mind at some point during my twisting and turning, in search of answers to these questions, and of course, sleep. 


Yet, as temporary as anything that would pop into my teenage mind, these ponderings rarely ever grew technical and rigorous. If I was intrigued by something, I would soon forget it in exchange for sleep. Yet, how I wish these mindless questions could turn into something fruitful and tangible—something I can point to and say “Yes—that are my thoughts about this.” Perhaps, a carefully argued paper would be perfect, but of course, with no tight deadlines and no sense of worth to devoting 5 weeks of my time to writing a paper that would be read by nobody, I wouldn’t do anything. 


So, in the end, nothing happens.


But, what if there was some starting ground for my ramblings? Could there be any benefit to storing these thoughts, solidifying them into something fruitful? 


While I understand that weird philosophical questions are not for everyone, least when they are trying to sleep, an earlier exposure to philosophy would be beneficial.
