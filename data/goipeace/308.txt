How everyone can live together without fighting except for humans.


1. Description of earth's ecosystems - Bustling with life
   1. Last sentence: It was a bustling ecosystem of life, until the humans came.
2.   Nature consists of millions of species, all with different goals. Yet, they have learned to coexist with each other, and to all compromise to build something astonishingly massive: nature. Nature has not learned how to build bombs to kill, but it has learned how to cooperate and compromise. 
3. Conclusion
   1. If the only thing that is separating us from civilized constructive citizens of Earth to our destructive human nature is the Geneva Convention, then we are surely doomed as humanity.
What can we learn from nature? Is to sacrifice our greed for a more sustainable life.
