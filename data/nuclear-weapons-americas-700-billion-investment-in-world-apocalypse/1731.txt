Metal Cylinders or World Apocalypse: America’s $700 Billion Investment in Nuclear Weapons


Nuclear budget (52.4 bn)
* If nuclear bombs deter wars, then why does the United States spend an average of $50 billion dollars per year to keep building more and more nuclear bombs? Why does Russia also allocates a large portion of its national budget towards building more nuclear bombs? Aren’t a few enough to act as a deterrent?
   * Playing with fire.
   * Recall history
   * US squandering 106 bn on nuclear defense system for the next ten years (2012-2021), but we are not testing them to see if they actually work
      * That also raises the question, that if the thousand and some nuclear bombs we have deter the prospects of a nuclear war, then why are we also spending an additional $106 billion on a defense system? 
   * The Times reports, in lieu of the looming North Korean nuclear missile threats, “[as part] of the multibillion-dollar effort to intercept a North Korean warhead, [the Pentagon] hopes to demonstrate that it has fixed a system that has worked in fewer than half of its previous nine tests.” The unfortunate reality is
* If an outright nuclear war has never happened, then why are we so adamant on preventing it? 
   * Could we be spending 50 bn every year to prevent something that has never happened, and will never happen? 
   * The last time US tested nuclear missile was in 1992. Since then, we have been spending billions of dollars on building more nuclear missiles, but not testing them. 
   * We do not know if this vast sum of money is used to build nuclear warheads or metal cylinders. The only way we can know is if we destroy the entire world, or let the rest of the world destroy us.
* Other argument: possibly because of us building nuclear weapons, no war has happened
   * Look in light of the peacekeeping progress we have made since the last time we dropped the atomic bomb, from NATO to the United Nations to joint trade alliances that have all bounded nations together. 
   * We can use the phrase, “correlation does not imply causation,” and argue that simply because nuclear bombs existed at a time of mostly world peace did not mean nuclear bombs caused world peace. While this also means peacekeeping initiatives does not necessarily equate to world peace, the reason
