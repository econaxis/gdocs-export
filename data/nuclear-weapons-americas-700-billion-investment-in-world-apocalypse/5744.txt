Nuclear Weapons: America’s $700 Billion Investment in World Apocalypse[1]


Introduction


America will spend $700 billion building metal cylinders for the next ten years. We will not tackle this queer project with humility and acknowledge its utter stupidity, but marvel at its terror. We will placate our disturbed[a] consciences with Orwellian doublethink principles, and insist that mutual fear breeds mutual peace, and mutual secrecy breeds mutual trust.

Nuclear budget (52.4 bn)
* If nuclear bombs deter wars, then why does the United States spend an average of $50 billion dollars per year to keep building more and more nuclear bombs? Why does Russia also allocates a large portion of its national budget towards building more nuclear bombs? Aren’t a few enough to act as a deterrent?
   * Playing with fire.
   * Recall history
   * US squandering 106 bn on nuclear defense system for the next ten years (2012-2021), but we are not testing them to see if they actually work
      * That also raises the question, that if the thousand and some nuclear bombs we have deter the prospects of a nuclear war, then why are we also spending an additional $106 billion on a defense system? 
   * The Times reports, in lieu of the looming North Korean nuclear missile threats, “[as part] of the multibillion-dollar effort to intercept a North Korean warhead, [the Pentagon] hopes to demonstrate that it has fixed a system that has worked in fewer than half of its previous nine tests.” 
   * The reality is not a utopia where nuclear weapons will forever spend their lives in underground silos. Rather, it is an unfortunate reality of upping the ante and the realization that one day, we will all fall to our own creations.
* If an outright nuclear war has never happened, then why are we so adamant on preventing it? 
   * Could we be spending 50 bn every year to prevent something that has never happened, and will never happen? 
   * The last time US tested nuclear missile was in 1992. Since then, we have been spending billions of dollars on building more nuclear missiles, but not testing them. 
   * We do not know if this vast sum of money is used to build nuclear warheads or metal cylinders. The only way we can know is if we destroy the entire world, or let the rest of the world destroy us.
* Other argument: possibly because of us building nuclear weapons, no war has happened
   * Look in light of the peacekeeping progress we have made since the last time we dropped the atomic bomb, from NATO to the United Nations to joint trade alliances that have all bounded nations together. 
   * We can use the phrase, “correlation does not imply causation,” and argue that simply because nuclear bombs existed at a time of mostly world peace did not mean nuclear bombs caused world peace. While this also means peacekeeping initiatives does not necessarily equate to world peace, building nuclear bombs for the sole reason of deterring a world war is utterly flawed. 
* Are we brave enough to use it?
   * Questions of the reliability of our $5.48 trillion nuclear arsenal[2] aside, can we imagine the possible circumstances for which we may use a nuclear bomb 10-50 times more powerful than the one dropped on Hiroshima? 170 kiloton missiles[3] will not solve the problem of rising terrorist threats, nor will it solve the problems of… 
   * These nuclear bombs will only accomplish their purpose after the world is destroyed. 
   * When would the United States ever need to deploy its thousands of nuclear warheads?
      * When the world is literally destroyed, would one warhead make any difference between win and lose?
* There are better ways to keep peace then making other countries fear
   * Fear breeds distrust, lies, and eventually, war
* According to Michael Mills, atmospheric scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado, detonating 100 nuclear warheads, each with 15 kt of energy, could cause “widespread damage to human health, agriculture, and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.” The 5.5 million tons of black soot caused by 100 relatively small nuclear detonations would rise up and block the sunlight. Mills also writes, “The combined cooling and enhanced UV would put significant pressures on global food supplies and could trigger a global nuclear famine.” 
* Global nuclear famine by only detonating 100 relatively small 15 kt nuclear bombs. The US nuclear contains 4650 nuclear warheads, ranging from 0.01 kt to 1200 kt. If just 100 small nuclear bombs are enough to “trigger a global nuclear famine,” then detonating all of our nuclear bombs would be a global apocalypse.
   * Thus, the question follows: if the nuclear arsenal we have currently is enough to destroy the entire world, then what is the point of squandering $50 billion every year to ensure the world is more destroyed? This is not a discussion of whether the $50 billion is better used elsewhere; it is rather a discussion about spending $50 billion to destroy something that will already be destroyed.


Conclusions


Nuclear deterrence is a myth
If nuclear weapons do work as a war deterrent, then why are the two leading countries in nuclear weapons, US and Russia, racing to create more and more nuclear weapons? 


As the 2 avenues of where nuclear weapons could be used has been closed off, there is little to justify $50 billion on bombs that will spend their whole lives in silos. A better name for these bombs would be metal cylinders—then we could at least see the absurdity of splurging $50 billion. 


Nuclear bombs do not deter wars in the same way as fear and hatred do not deter violence. Nuclear deterrence is an untested hypothesis, existing only in our utopian imaginations. In a world where countries constantly look over their shoulders and (nervously) peer into the[b][c]ir enemies’ nuclear arsenals, how can we ever think mutual fear breeds peace? Nuclear deterrence will only work in a world with trust, transparency, and a lack of mutual fear; quite frankly, this is the opposite of what nuclear deterrence entails: mutual fear and secrecy.




The debate is no longer about decreasing nuclear spending to better our crumbling healthcare and revive our education system. Nor is it about spending $50 billion to maintain second-strike capability and bring our enemies down with us. No—it is now a debate about spending $50 billion to destroy something that will already be destroyed.

Yes, I am saying that “if nuclear weapons are held by adversarial countries, then a deterrence effect preventing war between them will not occur.”


Argument 1: If nuclear bombs do deter wars, then why are the US spending $55 billion[1] in 2012 (which is expected to rise)? Why is Russia spending $15 billion USD [2] on its own nuclear weapons?


The hypothesis that 2 nuclear countries would not fight a war because doing so would ensure both sides are completely annihilated is only that: a hypothesis. This hypothesis can be summed up as “mutually assured destruction deters war.”  If mutually assured destruction was indeed valid, then why would both of the leading nuclear countries, US and Russia, spend enormous amounts of money to “modernize,” expand, and upgrade their nuclear arsenals? After all, nuclear weapons would destroy everything, why build one more warhead to destroy something that has been reduced to ashes? 


Also, Brendan Green, assistant professor of Poli Sci at U of Cincinnati, has published a paper arguing that mutually assured destruction (MAD) could be “escaped” by one country by denying another country of second-strike capabilities (e.g. Country A’s missiles are so advanced they destroy the capabilities of Country B to launch missiles—thus, Country A escapes MAD while Country B is destroyed). The Russians feared the US could “escape” MAD and destroy Russia, denying Russia’s chances of retaliating. Brendan Green suggests that nuclear balance could be “more malleable.” [3]


This is why US and Russia are both racing to expand their nuclear arsenals—both are aware MAD is escapable and malleable. In short, fear does not deter wars; it only raises the ante. 
Argument 2: Why is the US building nuclear missile defense systems? 


If just the existence of nuclear weapons is enough to deter any country from attacking, then why is the US squandering $44 billion to build a nuclear defense system that has a “40% success rate?” Why are they ready to put out $224 million just to test the capabilities of a $44 billion system? Surely, according to the nuclear deterrence hypothesis, North Korea or any other nuclear country wouldn’t dare to bomb us, as they will be destroyed too. Why, then, build a $44 billion dollar system that only works 40% of the time [4]? It’s because nuclear deterrence is only an untested hypothesis.


In fact, according to source [1], $174 billion of the $700 billion ten year nuclear budget will be spent on “missile defense,” “Nuclear Threat Reduction,” and “Nuclear Incident Management.” Couldn’t this money be used to build more warheads, and raise the risks of mutually assured destruction, and altogether decrease the chances of a nuclear war? No—destruction does not equal peace, and fear does not equal harmony.
