Nuclear Weapons: America’s $700 Billion Investment in World Apocalypse[1]


Nuclear budget (52.4 bn)
* If nuclear bombs deter wars, then why does the United States spend an average of $50 billion dollars per year to keep building more and more nuclear bombs? Why does Russia also allocates a large portion of its national budget towards building more nuclear bombs? Aren’t a few enough to act as a deterrent?
   * Playing with fire.
   * Recall history
   * US squandering 106 bn on nuclear defense system for the next ten years (2012-2021), but we are not testing them to see if they actually work
      * That also raises the question, that if the thousand and some nuclear bombs we have deter the prospects of a nuclear war, then why are we also spending an additional $106 billion on a defense system? 
   * The Times reports, in lieu of the looming North Korean nuclear missile threats, “[as part] of the multibillion-dollar effort to intercept a North Korean warhead, [the Pentagon] hopes to demonstrate that it has fixed a system that has worked in fewer than half of its previous nine tests.” The unfortunate reality is
* If an outright nuclear war has never happened, then why are we so adamant on preventing it? 
   * Could we be spending 50 bn every year to prevent something that has never happened, and will never happen? 
   * The last time US tested nuclear missile was in 1992. Since then, we have been spending billions of dollars on building more nuclear missiles, but not testing them. 
   * We do not know if this vast sum of money is used to build nuclear warheads or metal cylinders. The only way we can know is if we destroy the entire world, or let the rest of the world destroy us.
* Other argument: possibly because of us building nuclear weapons, no war has happened
   * Look in light of the peacekeeping progress we have made since the last time we dropped the atomic bomb, from NATO to the United Nations to joint trade alliances that have all bounded nations together. 
   * We can use the phrase, “correlation does not imply causation,” and argue that simply because nuclear bombs existed at a time of mostly world peace did not mean nuclear bombs caused world peace. While this also means peacekeeping initiatives does not necessarily equate to world peace, building nuclear bombs for the sole reason of deterring a world war is utterly flawed. 
* Are we brave enough to use it?
   * Questions of the reliability of our $5.48 trillion nuclear arsenal[2] aside, can we imagine the possible circumstances for which we may use a nuclear bomb 10-50 times more powerful than the one dropped on Hiroshima? 170 kiloton missiles[3] will not solve the problem of rising terrorist threats, nor will it solve the problems of… 
   * These nuclear bombs will only accomplish their purpose after the world is destroyed. 
   * When would the United States ever need to deploy its thousands of nuclear warheads?
      * When the world is literally destroyed, would one warhead make any difference between win and lose?
* There are better ways to keep peace then making other countries fear
   * Fear breeds distrust, lies, and eventually, war
* According to Michael Mills, atmospheric scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Colorado, detonating 100 nuclear warheads, each with 15 kt of energy, could cause “widespread damage to human health, agriculture, and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.” The 5.5 million tons of black soot caused by 100 relatively small nuclear detonations would rise up and block the sunlight. Mills also writes, “The combined cooling and enhanced UV would put significant pressures on global food supplies and could trigger a global nuclear famine.” 
* Global nuclear famine by only detonating 100 relatively small 15 kt nuclear bombs. The US nuclear contains 4650 nuclear warheads, ranging from 0.01 kt to 1200 kt. If just 100 small nuclear bombs are enough to “trigger a global nuclear famine,” then detonating all of our nuclear bombs would be a global apocalypse.
   * Thus, the question follows: if the nuclear arsenal we have currently is enough to destroy the entire world, then what is the point of squandering $50 billion every year to ensure the world is more destroyed? This is not a discussion of whether the $50 billion is better used elsewhere; it is rather a discussion about spending $50 billion to destroy something that will already be destroyed.
