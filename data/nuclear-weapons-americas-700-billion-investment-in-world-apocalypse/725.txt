Nuclear bombs don’t actually deter wars 


* If nuclear bombs deter wars, then why does the United States spend an average of $50 billion dollars per year to keep building more and more nuclear bombs? Why does Russia also allocates a large portion of its national budget towards building more nuclear bombs? Aren’t a few enough to act as a deterrent?
   * Playing with fire.
   * Recall history
   * US spending $150 billion on nuclear defense systems, but we are not testing them to see if they actually work
      * That also raises the question, that if the thousand and some nuclear bombs we have deter the prospects of a nuclear war, then why are we also spending an additional $150 billion on a defense system? 
* If an outright nuclear war has never happened, then why are we so adamant on preventing it? 
   * Could we be spending 50 bn every year to prevent something that has never happened, and will never happen? 
   * The last time US tested nuclear missile was in 1992. Since then, we have been spending billions of dollars on building more nuclear missiles, but not testing them. 
   * We do not know if this vast sum of money is used to build nuclear warheads or metal cylinders. The only way we can know is if we destroy the entire world, or 
* Other argument: possibly because of us building nuclear weapons, no war has happened
