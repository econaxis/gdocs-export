Most students think that teachers are lucky, they do not have any homework to do. However, I think of teachers are unlucky. Why? Because they have to deal with misbehaving kids or unfinished homework ,et cetera. Moreover, they have to mark tons and tons of homework done by students compared to doing one single page of math. Today, I am going to write about me being a teacher, and what I would do if I was a teacher.
Being a teacher sounds crazy to every student, including me. If I was a teacher, then I would give them textbooks to do, and homework to be completed, but I do not check it. Then when the tests finally come, all the students who had done their homework should be fine with all the questions in the tests. But the students who had not done their homework will not know anything about the test. But that does not mean that the test affects 100% of their grade, sometimes I will check their homework if it is a really important lesson. That is what my teacher does when he assigns math homework. I know this guy, who has skipped his math homework like 99% of the time
