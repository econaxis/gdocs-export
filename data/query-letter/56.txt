The old man stood hunched over the block of wood and watched the workers scramble around in the hot summer day. His stare would be occasionally disturbed by a grumpy motorcyclist. He was the neighborhood’s repairman. Then, his eyes would stare a little higher, as the floors rised higher and higher above the roofs of the surrounding houses. Then, it would be bedtime and he would sleep, only to go out in the morning and look just a little higher at the developing high-rise.
 
As old Vietnamese houses and my old tightly-knit culture gets torn apart by rich Western investors and luxury high-rises, dozens, including the repairman, from the surrounding 1-story “shacks” are beginning to get anxious.

Since I had lived in that neighborhood, exactly in one of the metal-roofed “shacks,” and know some of the people there, this article will include interviews with some of the residents, excerpts from the company developing these new luxury condos, as well as a personal side drawing from the first 7 years of my life, when I had lived in that exact neighborhood.
