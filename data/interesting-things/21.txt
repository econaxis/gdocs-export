----------------quora the good in the very bad
My dog died on my birthday. My debit card got disabled, and they can’t figure out why. The campus bus wasn’t running today so I had a half-hour walk home in the noon heat. I came home and all of my water was warm. My fridge got turned down by accident and froze all of my fruit. I have homework, but due to said debit card issue, I have no textbooks.


I hit my head on my desk.


It’s been one of those weeks.


I saw the question on Quora, “What is the best thing that has happened to you today?”


“Nothing,” I say as I sit in an air-conditioned dorm room.


“Nothing good has happened today,” I say as I do classwork at a university, something my parents never got the chance to do.


“Nope. Not one thing,” I say as I Snapchat friends on my iPhone.


There are very, very, very few situations that do not have a bright side.


My dog died, but we didn’t have to make the painful decision to put him down.


My card doesn’t work, but I’m not spending money on things I don’t need.


The bus wasn’t running, but I got in a good walk.


My fruit was frozen, but I found out that frozen grapes are actually pretty good.


It can be really damn difficult to find the positives in some situations.


In the end of the day, if you can find no other positives, just remember:


You’re alive; that in and of itself is a gift, even if it doesn’t always feel like one. Many people no longer have the luxury of living.


You’re lucky to be alive right now, and we’re lucky to have you.


Just remember that.
