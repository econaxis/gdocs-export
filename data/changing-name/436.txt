Why I want to change my name
I have to frequently correct my name for other people when I am in a new class or school, and that is not very convenient. My current name is very hard to pronounce, and I would just like for it to be easier for other people. 


I also sometimes get pretty embarrassed when the teachers call out my name and then it sounds really weird. Changing my name to be more English fixes all of those problems. 


Changing my name will also simplify many cases where I forget to say my official name. It often ends up with me having my english name in one place and my vietnamese name on the other, so then, I get confused because there are so many names to keep track of, and say, when they are asking for my name, I have to test my Vietnamese name first, and then test my English name to see if one is in the system.


People will also ask me to spell it out for them, while spelling out Henry is a breeze.
