Experiment 1: 


After 3 days, before stirring:
* Red
* Solid
* Near the base
* Semi-clear water
* Dust like
* Water no longer blue
* Sediment coming out of water


After 3 days, after stirring:
* Consistent, deeper red colour
* Milky
* Some particles undissolved on the bottom
* Darker after stirring
* Concentration contour lines from different light refractive indexes of different concentrations. 




Quantitative (After 3 days and after stirring): Temperature, the existence of Cu2+, mass, change in density




Procedure for measuring temperature quantitatively
1. Record the temperature of the starting blue solution of copper chloride using a thermometer. Make sure that the tip of the thermometer is in the solution rather than touching the walls of the beaker, as this may change the recorded temperature significantly.
2. Submerge a known amount of aluminum foil into the solution, watching the temperature rise in the thermometer. 
3. Watch the thermometer carefully as the reaction continues vigorously. 
4. Watch the thermometer until the temperature begins to drop, again making sure the tip is in the solution and not touching the walls of the beaker.
5. Record the maximum temperature reached by the reaction.


Procedure for measuring absorbance
1. Pour a sample of the starting copper chloride solution into a beaker.
2. Pour the solution from the beaker into the cuvette, making sure to only touch the frosted portions of the glass.
3. Record the absorbance of the starting solution.
4. Run the reaction using the steps outlined the previous procedure. 
5. With the resulting mixture, pour into a gravity filtration setup and let the solid brown copper dry.
6. Measure the mass of the copper filtrate by difference using an analytical balance.
7. The filtered s
