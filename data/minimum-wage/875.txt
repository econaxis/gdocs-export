Minimum wage


* Is not an indicator of economic growth/stability
   * Nordic countries/European countries have no minimum wage
   * China has no minimum wage

The minimum wage could be hailed as one of the marking achievements of democracy—almost spawning a new human right in itself: the right to valuable work. Just looking at the minimum wage simply, it is obvious that the minimum wage is very beneficial in reducing the pay gap, an increasing problem in today’s society. 


The pay gap was an unintended consequence of today’s democracy, in that the richer you are, the more likely you will become rich. In addition, the opposite effect also happens, in that the poorer you are, the more likely you are to become poorer, or the less likely you are to become richer. In order to satisfy this pay gap, the government had the ingenious idea to lower or try to remediate this growing gap in pay between the super-rich and the poor, to install a minimum wage. 


While this seems like a great idea at first, elevating the starting pedestal for poor people and making it easier for them to enter into the middle class, and after that, have a higher chance of climbing up the ladder. However, looking deeper at the economics of this issue reveals a big problem that our compassionate and feel-good emotions did not pry. Simple supply and demand rules contradict this blatant manipulation of economic guidelines in favor of shallow emotions, and simply installing a universal minimum wage without any consideration for the discrepancies and the nuances of each market is simply immature. 


Common arguments for raising the minimum wage include it being not livable, with many of the more proactive activists citing examples of families living under 1 or 2 minimum wages. While their situation is not the best and certainly does not reflect well on Western democracy, blaming it on the minimum wage is entirely wrong and misguided. Just because they struggle to find a job and have to struggle with the minimum wage still doesn’t mean that we should increase the minimum wage just for these people and ignore all the other consequences that occur as a result.
