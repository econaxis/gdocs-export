“It’s all for the second generation.”
                                                
I was a small child at that time, sitting in a table full of adults. We had immigrated to Canada 5 years ago, and were visiting Vietnam now. I hadn’t seen any of my relatives in those 5 years, and seeing them again brought the same awkwardness accompanied with meeting people for the first time.
                                                
After all of the formal introductions and the shame associated with forgetting the outskirts of my family, we sat down to eat a steaming hot pot of vegetables and meat and lamb and pork and all the Vietnamese foods I had forgotten. It was so different to the Costco poutine I frequented or the lukewarm hot pots with barely any meat in it that my mother would cook.
                                                
The conversation had been dominated by my dad and my uncle. Both were loud, argumentative men with little regard for manners, so it was hard for anyone to join in, let alone a boy who had forgotten all of his relatives. My dad was like a little boy who had just escaped from his parents restrictions. Canada had imposed a strict set of social rules that my dad hated. My uncle and my dad laughed and talked like normal Vietnamese men, while eating dozens of different foods while, with his dirty chopsticks, picked dozens of other food to put on my plate. I never knew he was that good at multitasking.
                                                
The conversation quickly steered to my dad’s work. It wasn’t a source of pride for our family, but my dad would still talk about it like old Vietnamese men would.
                                                
“I just do it for this guy,” my dad said, patting my back, “It’s all for the second generation. I could just relax, downsize, and live comfortably. But all because of this guy. I have to work hard because of this guy.” My dad looked down at me, and shook his head.
                                                
Everybody else laughed. My dad continued to shake his head. I wasn’t sure if I was in trouble, or my dad was just fooling. Thankfully, my dad laughed, and so did I.
                                                
“Hey! What about me! I work hard for you two for more than 20 years and nobody says anything?” My grandpa grunted with the weak voice that infects old people.
                                                
Everybody laughed again. I laughed. Even Grandpa coughed out what seemed to be a laugh.

From now, even when I complain that the office coffee machine is down or somebody stole my food in the fridge, the “It’s all for the second generation,” from long ago flies back and hits me.
                                                
“How dare I complain about that? My parents had slaved away doing manual labour, and here I was, complaining about a coffee machine!” This thought process turns my complaints to bouts of regret and nostalgia, at least while I wait for the coffee machine to turn back on.
