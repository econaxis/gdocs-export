Think of a specific moment when you were at a crossroads, major or minor. For example: screwing up the courage to ask someone on a date, deciding if you should fight back at someone who affronted you, unpacking in your first college dorm room, standing on the altar about to be married. Zero in on that specific moment. Remember all that you can about that moment, perhaps even jotting things down. What did you see, hear, smell, touch, or taste? What were you thinking or feeling?


Now try to write about this moment, bringing it to life on the page. (Use the details you remembered.) You may allude to things before and after, but stay mostly focused on that exact moment in time.
Try to keep it under 500 words, with 750 words as a maximum.

The chutes were infamous for common avalanches and low visibility even on a perfect sunny day. And I was about to ski it. In the middle of a snowstorm.
