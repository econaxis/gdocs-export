1. The initiator of the contract – was it the man or the devil? Also was the request done knowingly or accidentally? What was the reason for even considering a contract?
2. The terms of the contract –What does the man have to give? What must the devil do for him? Is there a blood seal?
3. Length of time given – How long does the man get to enjoy the benefits of the contract? Is it worth it? Is it open ended or fixed?
4. The ending: does the author allow for repentance or is he set on condemnation? Why change the way the story ends? What affects the change in endings?


Using all materials relevant to Renaissance Humanism and the play Dr. Faustus by Christopher Marlowe, write a short essay in which you address the following areas:
1. Thesis statement.
2. One body paragraph that discusses how Dr. Faustus supports one tenet of Classical Humanism.
3. One body paragraph that discusses either another worldview presented in the work or something that goes against the dominant worldview. 
4. Restatement of thesis but no formal conclusion. (one sentence is all you need!)
5. Work cited only if you use information out of the Classical humanism article.


Supports Classical Humanism 
* One element of the Faust legend, the initiation of the contract, stems from Dr. Faust’s desire to do what he could not, and surpass the limits set by human nature and God. 
* This pleasure sustains itself until almost the very end, when Dr. Faust’s impending doom overwhelms his characteristically human mind, when he reverts back to God and realizes that no matter how hard he tries, he will never be at the same level as God. 
* While Faustus’s abandonment of scholarly activities and consequently, reason so highly endowed by classical humanism, betrays the classical humanism worldview, his abandonment of Christianity and the Church represents the classical humanism worldview. 
* Another element of classical humanism in this play is Faustus’s recurring rejection of Christian and God, and even when he doubts himself the most, always chooses the side of evil. 


2. The Christian Worldview
* Near the end, when he cries out for help from God
* The recurring theme of the “good” throughout the story—symbolizes that God is everywhere and eternal?
   * Support of that idea: how he exposes his barest form of human nature and in desperation calls for God to help—he surrenders to God, and acknowledges that God is stronger.
