Using all materials relevant to Renaissance Humanism and the play Dr. Faustus by Christopher Marlowe, write a short essay in which you address the following areas:
1. Thesis statement.
2. One body paragraph that discusses how Dr. Faustus supports one tenet of Classical Humanism.
3. One body paragraph that discusses either another worldview presented in the work or something that goes against the dominant worldview. 
4. Restatement of thesis but no formal conclusion. (one sentence is all you need!)
5. Work cited only if you use information out of the Classical humanism article.
