The Corner Nail Salon: A Painful Stepping Stone


An immigrant Vietnamese family of 2 middle-aged parents and 2 sons live in a cramped 1 bedroom apartment in suburban Mississauga, right besides Toronto. The parents work 10 hours daily in a corner nail salon just outside of Chinatown, painting nails with fake poison. In the Vietnamese immigrant community, they are living the equivalent of the American Dream. 


The stagnant smell of nail polish and acrylics attacked me as I entered cousin’s nail salon. I was 37 years old at that time, and my cousin had just immigrated to Canada from Vietnam. Aside from the small glass door covered with ads, there was no ventilation--no windows, vents, or fans. They must have noticed my discomfort. “Don’t worry. It’s normal. All the other nail salons in this area are like this.”


My cousin and his wife were not refugees. They had made decent upper-middle class salary in Vietnam, before moving to Canada. Now, they work at a corner nail salon for less than minimum wage on the outskirts of Chinatown. 


I went to their home after visiting the nail salon.“It’s all for the second generation,” my cousin’s wife explains while cooking soup from a stove that had lost its front cover. She’d bought it from a yard sale. “The kids are studying most of the time, because, we tell them, that if they don’t study, then have to work hard like us” She doesn’t speak with sadness or regret, just with the convincing authority that all parents hold.


“We would be back in Vietnam if it wasn’t for the children,” my cousin frowns and stares towards the ceiling, as if reminiscing the life he could have had. We pause, silence filling the room. 
“Help mom set the table!” he shouts to his children.
“No, no! No need. Just let them study.” his wife quickly reassures. Then, she says the same thing once again, just a bit louder, so her kids can keep on studying.


They tell us stories of the other Vietnamese immigrants in the community while the children eat with us in silence. Throughout all of the stories they told me, one theme stayed similar: most immigrants worked in nail salons. “There’s just no way out,” she said. 


Unless you already had skills and enough English for Canada, your only option of getting a job was a nail salon. After all, it makes sense for an immigrant to enter an industry whose requirements are only sharp eyes and poison tolerance. For example, of the 581,946 Vietnamese[1] living in California, around 200,000 are licensed nail salon workers[2]. As for the whole of US, 48% of all licensed nails workers are Vietnamese. 


No matter how hard you worked, or what skills you had, whether a doctor or a plumber, your only option to become successful in Canada was to work as much as possible, so your kids have the best chance. And these kids really do have a good chance.


One of the children in the “nail salon” community will be graduating medical school in 2019, and many others receive the best grades in their school.
Perhaps, this resigned mindset of many Vietnamese immigrants—that the first generation immigrant’s life is tied to the nail salon—is why so many second-generation Vietnamese have a stable life. Or, perhaps, it is a false misconception borne from the origins of the Vietnamese immigrant community. Misconception or not, however, the nail salon serves as a painful stepping stone, taunting the first-generation immigrants bound to its 10 hour workdays and acrylic poison. But for the second-generation, the nail salon brings the subsequent success, a strong head start, but also the weekends alone, eating instant ramen.
