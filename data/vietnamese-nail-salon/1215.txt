Vietnamese Immigrants and Nails Salons


Equivalent to a minimum-wage McDonalds worker, but without the negative stigma being a fast food worker carries.


“Sacrifice to the second generation”


No end to grinding—have to work in nails salon for long hours with little pay


There is an immigrant Vietnamese family of 2 middle-aged parents and 2 sons, 10 and 13 years old. The parents work from 8AM to 10PM in a corner nail salon, painting nails with fake powder and dealing with grumpy customers. They live in a cramped 1 bedroom apartment in suburban Mississauga, situated besides Toronto. In the Vietnamese immigrant community, they are living the equivalent of the American Dream. 


History has dictated that first-generation immigrants will be nail salon workers. From Vancouver to Toronto to New York, if you peer into one of the little Vietnamese-run nails salons on street corners, you will see middle-aged immigrants, some illegal, who can barely speak English hunched over on their stools, meticulously working others’ nails. There is no thought of any other career—some require too much English, some require too many certifications, and some (e.g. fast food worker) carry such a negative stigma in the Vietnamese community, that immigrants are willing to sacrifice a lower wage and nonexistent workplace safety.


These families are not refugees, nor are they poor. Some were middle-class families who wanted a new life in America. Some were white-collar workers who abandoned a stable life in Vietnam in favor of more opportunities for their children.
