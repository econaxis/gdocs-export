My parents are very similar in many aspects. First, they are both parents of two kids. They also care about their children’s homework very much. Their parent would give them homework everyday. In addition, they are both humans, not aliens. This enables them to properly communicate with other humans in this Earth. Both of the parents are from Vietnam, so they would rather communicate and play with other Vietnamese people. In addition, they both have black hair. Furthermore, they both have full body parts, such as hands, fingers, toes, feet, and eyes. The parents also use their phone while going to the washroom. However, the male one uses his cell phone more than the female. 
        Despite these similarities, both of them also have differences such as gender, personality, and health. One of the parents is male, but the other one is female. In addition, they have different personality. The male one is more humorous, but he focuses more on his sons’ education than the female one. In contrast, the female one is more serious but focuses less on her sons’ education, but more on health. +
