The Parents Mike and Ann
 
                Many people differ from one another, and nobody is completely the same. Likewise, parents are different in some aspects and similar in others. Born in Vietnam, Mike and Ann care about their children. However, he focuses more on his children’s education whereas she focuses more on her children’s health. I think that they are similar and different.
Mike and Ann are the same in many aspects. First, they are both parents of two kids. They also care about their children’s homework. The parents give their sons homework every day. In addition, they are both humans, not aliens. This enables them to properly communicate with other humans in this Earth. Mike and Ann are from Vietnam, so they prefer to communicate with other Vietnamese people. The parents also use their phones while going to the washroom. However, Mike uses his cell phone more than Ann in the restroom. They also believe in buddhism.
                Despite these similarities, both of them are also different in many aspects such as their gender, health, personality. The husband is more humorous, but he focuses more on his sons’ education than the wife. In contrast, she is more serious but concentrates less on her children’s education and more on their health. Ann’s most important job is to cook whereas Mike’s main job is to fix broken appliances. He complains that he works too much, but actually, he experiences less stress than her.
                The parents have things in common and some in contrast. They are both born in Vietnam, although in different cities. In contrast, the man uses his phone more in the bathroom than the female one. In my opinion, Ann is better in general than Mike.
