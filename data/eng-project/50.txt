Young Boy Dies from Family’s Own Security System
A young boy has died from wounds from the family’s security system. We do know that he was caught fairly deep in barbed wire, but we will spare you the specific details. 


There are some who believe that bigger is better. And there are some, like this family, that take it to a next level. Their concentration-camp style walls, decorated with lovely barbed wire on top, is surely bigger than all the other ones in the neighbourhood. But, perhaps, this incident proves that it is not necessarily better. 


Rather than adorning the wall and barbed wire with shrubs and plants, as any sensible person would, the family had also decided to expose all of the ugliness of DRAGON’s TEETH security. So exposed, in fact, that even a child could climb through it. 


This is the result when the mainstream media think it’s their job to report and describe in gory detail every single crime. An echo chamber of crime after crime, and a seclusion from the outside world breeds this kind of outrageous solution to a non-existent problem. Fear compounds when in seclusion, and perhaps, this horrific incident will instill some realism into the family. 


The family has got a hard decision now: remove the security system and admit their mistake, or maintain it in spite of their child getting caught in the barbed wire. 


This incident is a consequence of the mainstream media’s reliance on fear for ratings and viewers. In fear, outrageous ideas, such as a concentration-camp style security system, seem perfectly normal.
