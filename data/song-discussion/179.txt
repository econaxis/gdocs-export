In “Song,” Donne addresses his lover providing reasons for his departure. Speaking in an enthusiastic tone to his lover, Donne tries to reassure her that there is nothing to worry about his departure, and in five stanzas, gives us a complete picture of their intimate relationship. 


Donne addresses his lover’s presumably first concern that he is leaving because he does not love her, but rather because of a business trip. The other primary concern of any lover would be that their SO is leaving to find another love, but Donne also refutes that, saying “I do not go, For weariness of thee, Nor in hope the world can show A fitter love for me.”
