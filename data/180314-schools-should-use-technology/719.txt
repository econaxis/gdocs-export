When I was travelling with my dad home, I saw several students carrying devices. I began to wonder “ Are technologies being utilised by schools nowadays?” I could see why schools are now using technology to help them teach. First, students do not have to remember all of their homework that is due tomorrow; instead, they can just remember a device, which stores all of their homework for them. According to a national survey, 20% of the students do not complete homework; therefore, if there was a device which stores all their homework, we can hopefully decrease the percentage. Although using devices for homework results in too much screen time, scientists and psychologists say screen time can be good for children.
        Many students have a habit of forgetting homework; but with technology, we may hope to resolve and break that habit.
