There are many things that we humans do not understand, such as the mystery line in Mars; the line that scientists thought was made by aliens because they were too straight to be nature-made. Positive people always think that you can know everything in the world, but I think it is not that true because there is always more to learn and know about. I too, do not know everything and have some questions that I did not know the answer too for a very long time.
I was baffled for a really long time why we cannot work together but we have to fight, like bad guys do. Our world will be way ahead if every country united and we have one really strong leader. However, getting all the countries that want to be independent to unite is a really hard to do. But that is the first step to making a united world; we need to pick a really strong leader who would be brave enough to handle all the complaints and make everybody happy. Also, why do we fight, the results are bad, and everybody hate them, but why do countries always fight? Fighting loses men and makes people die, which is not good, but we still fight, that is the thing. Somebody needs to stand out and say to the world that we need to unite and work together. Well, I think the countries fight because they want to conquer more, but is it worth it? Losing thousands of men just to claim a kilometer squared of land? It is unbelievable that we would waste so much for just a piece of land. Now let’s talk provincially. Not only nations fight, but provinces in the nations fight too, so there is a lot of fighting happening here on Earth. There is also fighting locally, groups of terrorists or gangsters. I banning fighting and war will help us a great deal. No more fighting means no more wasting time and material building all the fighting machines, and using that time and material to do research on certain things.
