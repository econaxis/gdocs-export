In the poem “The Author to Her Book,” Bradstreet gives us a glimpse into the complex and intimate relationship between an author and their work, their “ill-formed offspring,” as denoted by Bradstreet. The poem’s extended metaphor about an author’s relationship to her work is strikingly similar to the relationship between a mother and her child. Bradstreet describes this complex relationship through this metaphor with characteristic elements from a mother-son relationship, as well as a change in attitude from the beginning to end-----------------------


Bradstreet takes the typical characteristics of a mother-son relationship and applies it cunningly to the relationship between her and her book.
