A Visit to a Friend’s House


In the game I played with my friends at a relative’s house last year, I felt nothing, I saw nothing, and I could feel nothing but the small wind as people dodged out of my way. My eyes were useless now. I have been the chaser, or in other words, the slender man. I could feel nothing but the air whiz through my sides. I also felt that I could bump and crush my nose into something, such as a chair or a wall, any time. I tried desperately to catch someone with my hands, but as usual, I feared that extending my hands to full length would knock something over. Finally, I managed to touch someone’s shirt; how good it felt to be released into the real world. In brief, although playing the game as the runners/dodgers from the chaser was fun, being the slender man was not fun at all.
In addition to the fun at the party, the food was very delicious. Mothers from all over North America made and brought their food to this very party. I enjoy my mom’s foods very much, but sometimes a variety or trying a new type of food is very pleasing. Vietnamese adults are always the same. Whenever they got a chance to talk, even in the bathrooms, they use that chance. Likewise, adults here were talking rapidly, another one talking a millisecond after one adult has finished. Therefore, it seemed as if the loud voices had been everywhere. Furthermore, the whole dining room had a Vietnamese foods smell to it, because the foods were made by Vietnamese mothers. In general, the Vietnamese foods that mothers made were very delicious; also, the adults at the dining table were talking rapidly.
