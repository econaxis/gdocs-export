In an age when sane political discussions almost always turn into angry, nonsensical brawls, when people vote based on group identity instead of their ideals, when 270 million firearms circulate a polarized nation traumatized by a recent terrorist attack, Bret Stephens wants to repeal the second amendment. You must be kidding me, Mr. Stephens.


The real problem with this audacious solution lies in the multitude of traditional values that guns bring to gun owners: freedom, masculinity, and power. While the lives of the 14,000 that are killed annually by firearms in the US are more important than respecting these traditional American values, the solution proposed by Mr. Stephens is too imposing, too sudden, and sounds too much of an attempt to be novel. The last time that the government had instated a law that split the nation in half had resulted in the Civil War. Now, Mr. Stephens is suggesting we do the same thing, except split the nation between angry gun owners with 270 million firearms at their disposal and the other half of the nation.
