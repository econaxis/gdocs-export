The Jabber, Fish Cheeks, On My Knees Bleeding


In each of these 3 stories, “The Jabber,” “Fish Cheeks,” and “On My Knees Bleeding,” the characters are in conflict with society’s norms about how they should behave. In all of these stories, the characters dislike the norms that their culture imposes upon them, and tries to challenge these norms. In “The Jabber,” the character succeeds in challenging these norms and in turn, her peers have acknowledged her differently than a stereotype. In the 2 other stories, their attempts to distance themselves from their stereotype have failed. The common themes remain similar, however, stating the value of identity on a person’s life and on how others treat them. 


The main character in “The Jabber,” Fatima, is subject to stereotypes about her in the new school. Even Jorah, her boyfriend, assumes that just because Fatima wears a hijab, that she conforms to every strict Islamic guideline. Jorah thinks she can’t behave normally and is restricted in what she can and cannot say. Fatima’s personality, revealed as the play progresses, is nothing like the stereotypes of Muslim women held by Jorah and even the viewers.
