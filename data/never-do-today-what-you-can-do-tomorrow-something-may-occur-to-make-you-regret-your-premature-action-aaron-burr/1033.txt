“Never do today what you can do tomorrow. Something may occur to make you regret your premature decision.”-Aaron Burr. This quote can be defined or interpreted two different ways, the first one can be literal, and the second one can be figurative. 
I think this quote is wrong because we have to prepare for the things that will happen tomorrow. We cannot just do things at the last minute. For example, the Potter family is going on a vacation to Hawaii, they cannot book all of their plane tickets, hotels, and pack up all their stuff in just the last minute, they have to do it earlier, so they can be ready and have everything packed up and ready to go once the time arrives.  However, the second part of this quote states that the premature actions are going to cause regret to the normal people. This can rarely happen if the Potter family thinks ahead of all the different possibilities and problems that can thwart their plans. In addition, we cannot be too prepared, and most decisions are not too “premature”. However, I have been in many plans that have been abandoned because something changed the beginning decision, and that caused a domino effect, which invalidated the other decisions. 
This quote can also be interpreted literally, tomorrow as “tomorrow”. We can do things tomorrow and finish them, but if we do it today, then we can do other things tomorrow and get on with our lives, instead of just sticking with the present. In addition, doing things that are supposed to be done tomorrow today can have very little difference and has a very rare change of there being another event that thwarts or changes the plan. 
Anyways, I don’t think that this quote is correct fully, neither is it incorrect fully.
