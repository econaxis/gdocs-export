1         4 Layers of Interpretation
1.1        Layer 1: Work
the most basic layer, dealing with solely the text, namely the form and the content.
Form includes genre/medium (poem/novel/play?), whether it is italicized (The Wind Our Enemy by Anne Marriott), structure of the poem (14 lines = sonnet). Form is also very dependent on literary period, and further questions for analysis would be what forms were popular then, the role of each form.
Content includes literary devices and use of language.
3 steps for literary devices are: definition, identification, and explanation (how they help the text).
Explanation is the most important in writing essays, HOW it helps the message/express tone.
1.2        Layer 2: Historical Context
Literature is embedded in history, and the two link back to each other.
Consider factors such as religion, wars, foreign affairs, entertainment, social structure, education…
First, why is the work in this literary period? Proof of the particular literary period?
Consider also the dominant worldview of the literary period, and its influences on the text
1.3        Layer 3: Modern Interpretations
Philosophical, “I feel,” how the themes connect to modern problems.
A good work has themes that transcend time.
1.4        Layer 4: Biblical Interpretation
Only for works with prominent Christianity references/Anglo Saxon era.
2         Anglo-Saxon Period
Very short period, considering that most of it was passed orally and lost before education and written language came to England.
2.1        Roman Period
In 56 B.C. Caesar first showed interest in expanding the Roman Isles by exploring the British Isles, but his attempts to colonize there failed as he could not overcome the barbaric peoples with his meager army. In 43 A. D., he became serious about colonization and brought in three Roman legions to Britain. The efforts were first successful in the Southwest, and they began to work with the Romans in establishing a government, trading posts, roads, as well as introduced Latin to the tribes. These Southern tribes then became more “Romanized” and less barbaric, however, the Northern tribes had not changed. In fact, the threat of attack from the Picts (who lived in present day Scotland) was so great that two legions were stationed along the border to prevent attacks. Hadrian’s Wall was a 72-mile wall with fortresses that stationed soldiers, built one mile apart.
 
As the Roman empire began to fall, troops stationed along this wall were gradually removed, which posed the Southern tribes which had become civilized the threat of attack from the still barbaric Northern tribes.
 
Rome left behind a common language: Latin. During that time, many of the words entered the English language, particularly ones that deal with law or the church. The tribes later adopted many words from other languages to fit their needs, resulting in English’s complicatedness.
2.2        Germanic Tribes Arrive
Conquests of Attila the Hun in the fifth century forced European tribes in his path to choose between two options: hold back his attacks, or move north-west and displace another tribe. However, on Denmark and northern regions of Germany, there were three tribes that had no where to go: the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. They decided to cross the English channel and made the pact with the Romanized people of South England that they would hold back attacks from the Northern tribes.
2.3        Anglo Saxon Culture
Although the three tribes (Angles, Saxons, and Jutes) were similar in background, they had formed separate kingdoms and warred against each other. Social structure of this society was two class system with earls, the ruling class, and churls, the servant class. Churls were often from members of opposing tribes that had been captured.
 
As they had lived in harsh conditions, tribes lived in a communal fashion, and every life was greatly valued as the tribes needed everyone in order to survive. Tribes shared all soils of war and members looked after each other, but turning against a person, especially of one’s own family, was the greatest sin and was punished by exile, and even death. Family was more important than everything to the Anglo-Saxons (why?)[1], and a lone person was viewed as highly suspicious because of their disloyal character. Their social organization was similar to three concentric circles: family being the innermost, next would be extended family and clan, and outermost would be the tribe.
 
Their culture was very interesting in that it had two facets: one of barbaric warriors who drank, believed in superstitions, and glorified revenge as a moral responsibility, and a second facet of storytelling. As most Anglo-Saxons were illiterate, stories were passed on orally, and the barbaric nature of Anglo-Saxon culture, as well as their fondness for words and heroes, complemented each other and saturated the storytelling.
 
For example, the sea is represented both as a monster that could end life at any moment, but also a means of travel and food—essentially a love-hate relationship. Many more love-hate relationships appear in Anglo-Saxon literature, another such example being the man-nature, worshiping nature for its violence and beauty, but also wary of its dangers, especially in a region like the British Isles.
In conclusion, the Anglo-Saxons had 2 classes, 1 culture, and 1 literature. 2 classes were earls and chearls, common culture was Germanic, and only one type of literature due to widespread illiteracy—resulting in most literature being oral traditions that appealed to the majority of people.
 
The common theme throughout Anglo-Saxon culture is that they were survivors. They survived the day and tried to survive the next day. As thus, most of their actions were not based on advanced planning, but rather on the belief that this was their last day.
 
2.4        Uniting the Island
Recall that the Angles and the Saxon groups were warring and divided. However, with the arrival of 2 invasions—one from Vikings and one from Normans—the two tribes united and there borne Alfred the Great, who supported the writing down of literature. The second invasion from the Normans dominated the Anglo-Saxons, which lead to the end of the Anglo-Saxon period and the beginning of the medieval period.
2.5        Christianity comes to England
The Northern part of the island had already been evangelized before the Angles, Saxons, and the Jutes traversed the channel, but Christianity had not spread down to the South yet. Contact with Britain was done as missionaries of the Roman Catholic Church travelled to Britain, and as Anglo-Saxons travelled to Rome for business. Pope Gregory of the Church was first struck by the heathen nation, primarily of its following of superstitions, the practice of polytheism, and slavery of one’s own people. While the Anglo-Saxons had only enslaved peoples of other tribes, the Pope held no distinction and regarded all those who lived in Britain as the same people.
 
2.6        St. Augustine of Canterbury
In 597 A.D., the pope sent Augustine of Canterbury to convert what the pope deamed as heathen people to Christianity. Augustine arrived and he had successfully converted a king in Canterbury to Christianity. Within two generations, the entire island was Christian (Catholic).
 
St. Augustine then built a monastery at Canterbury and soon set off a chain reaction that changed Anglo-Saxon literature greatly. They brought in Latin as a written language and transcribed oral stories such as Beowulf. Due to the slow nature of recording and translating (Old English to Latin), few Anglo Saxon literature was preserved.
2.6.1         Controversial Elements
1.     Canterbury was a pagan sacrifice ground that had nothing to do with the Church, and the construction of the monastery in Canterbury caused confusion. They decided to capitalize upon this, and the Anglo-Saxons did not understand that the church and the pagan sacrifice ground were two different identities.
2.     The Church did not deny the existence of pagan entities such as Wyrd, a deity of fate (the prime reality of the Anglo Saxons). Instead, they reasoned with the Anglo Saxons that God Jehovah was stronger than Wyrd, which had confused them even more.
3.     The monastery also held holidays around the holidays for pagan gods, so the people thought that they were an addition to the religion, rather than an entirely different religion. The converts, as a result, associated elements of paganism to Christianity which hid the true intentions of the missionaries.
4.     During the recording of Anglo-Saxon literature, missionaries inserted biblical interpretations and stories into spots where they found applicable, and is one of the reasons why we don’t have a pure sample of Anglo Saxon literature.
3         Beowulf
Beowulf is an epic that was imported from Denmark with Germanic origins. Originally, the story had been passed around as an oral epic and was not recorded. When the monks arrived in St.Augustine in Canterbury, they had transcribed the epic onto Latin. Since the Anglo Saxons were illiterate, however, they had no control over the accuracy, and the monks had often inserted biblical aspects into the story. Be wary of contradictions between fatalism and Christian Theism.
3.1        Summary
Beowulf is the classic superhero in Anglo-Saxon culture and goes on a mission to save one of the great houses from a monster. Through a series of conflicts and plot turns, all with Beowulf exhibiting model character and exemplifying all that the Anglo Saxons valued, Beowulf eventually wrangles the monster to death and returns home, triumphant.
3.2        Fatalism
Fatalism was a worldview all Anglo Saxons held, and had many of its influences based on the harsh climate they resided in. They were polytheistic with gods similar to the Norse gods. Their prime reality was the god Wyrd, who controlled all fate. He was not loving and was impersonal, and the only certainty that he would eventually kill all men—if not today, then perhaps tomorrow. They had little reason to plan for a future—set up agriculture, improve their social ladder—and lived their lives only based on the present. While the Anglo Saxons were unsure of an afterlife, they had indeed hoped for it, as proven from burial sites. The best they could do was act in accordance with their faith.
3.2.1       In Beowulf
The legendary Beowulf character in the epic lives his life according to fatalism—he wrangles monsters under the sea without any hesitance, and gladly accepts death if he sensed it was near. Beowulf epitomizes the qualities that Anglo Saxons most valued, namely bravery, loyalty, and strength.
