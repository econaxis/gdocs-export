1         4 Layers of Interpretation
1.1        Layer 1: Work
the most basic layer, dealing with solely the text, namely the form and the content.
Form includes genre/medium (poem/novel/play?), whether it is italicized (The Wind Our Enemy by Anne Marriott), structure of the poem (14 lines = sonnet). Form is also very dependent on literary period, and further questions for analysis would be what forms were popular then, the role of each form.
Content includes literary devices and use of language.
3 steps for literary devices are: definition, identification, and explanation (how they help the text).
Explanation is the most important in writing essays, HOW it helps the message/express tone.
1.2        Layer 2: Historical Context
Literature is embedded in history, and the two link back to each other.
Consider factors such as religion, wars, foreign affairs, entertainment, social structure, education…
First, why is the work in this literary period? Proof of the particular literary period?
Consider also the dominant worldview of the literary period, and its influences on the text
1.3        Layer 3: Modern Interpretations
Philosophical, “I feel,” how the themes connect to modern problems.
A good work has themes that transcend time.
1.4        Layer 4: Biblical Interpretation
Only for works with prominent Christianity references/Anglo Saxon era.
2         Anglo-Saxon Period
Very short period, considering that most of it was passed orally and lost before education and written language came to England.
2.1        Roman Period
In 56 B.C. Caesar first showed interest in expanding the Roman Isles by exploring the British Isles, but his attempts to colonize there failed as he could not overcome the barbaric peoples with his meager army. In 43 A. D., he became serious about colonization and brought in three Roman legions to Britain. The efforts were first successful in the Southwest, and they began to work with the Romans in establishing a government, trading posts, roads, as well as introduced Latin to the tribes. These Southern tribes then became more “Romanized” and less barbaric, however, the Northern tribes had not changed. In fact, the threat of attack from the Picts (who lived in present day Scotland) was so great that two legions were stationed along the border to prevent attacks. Hadrian’s Wall was a 72-mile wall with fortresses that stationed soldiers, built one mile apart.
 
As the Roman empire began to fall, troops stationed along this wall were gradually removed, which posed the Southern tribes which had become civilized the threat of attack from the still barbaric Northern tribes.
 
Rome left behind a common language: Latin. During that time, many of the words entered the English language, particularly ones that deal with law or the church. The tribes later adopted many words from other languages to fit their needs, resulting in English’s complicatedness.
2.2        Germanic Tribes Arrive
Conquests of Attila the Hun in the fifth century forced European tribes in his path to choose between two options: hold back his attacks, or move north-west and displace another tribe. However, on Denmark and northern regions of Germany, there were three tribes that had no where to go: the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes.
