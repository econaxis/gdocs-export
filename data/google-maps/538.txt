I suffer from an addiction to Google Maps. 


My first exposure to such a beautiful, yet simple program was as a 6 year old in the hot summer of Vietnam. I still remember that moment vividly, almost as if it had happened yesterday. I was playing random games on Miniclip or some other Vietnamese websites on my dad’s computer. Obviously, my dad had to be away for that to happen, and I seized just the right moment when he had exited the house to jump to the computer and type miniclip.com, almost in a rehearsed manner. 


It was destined that my dad would caught me, like a deer in the headlights on his computer one day—but the joys of shooting 2d zombies with laggy guns was too fun for my 5 year old mind to be put away from. And certainly, the inevitable did happen: the click clack of my dad’s boots as he entered the door, and the quick shuffling of feet as he ascended the stairs was too quick for me to pretend to get back to studying. The only thing I could do was to quickly fumble for the tab-close buttons and pretend to be obsessed with whatever appeared on the computer, which was, incidentally, Google Maps. I scrolled around absentmindedly, all the while my heart beating wildly as I realized how close I was to being shouted at.
