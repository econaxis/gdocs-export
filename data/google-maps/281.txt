I suffer from an addiction to Google Maps. 


My first exposure to such a beautiful, yet simple program was as a 6 year old in the hot summer of Vietnam. I still remember that moment vividly, almost as if it had happened yesterday. I was playing random games on Miniclip or some other Vietnamese websites on my dad’s computer. Obviously, my dad had to be away for that to happen, and I seized just the right moment when he had exited the house to jump to the computer and type miniclip.com, almost in a rehearsed manner. 


It was destined that my dad would caught me, like a deer in the headlights on his computer one day—but the joys of shooting 2d zombies with laggy guns was too fun for my 5 year old mind to be put away from.
