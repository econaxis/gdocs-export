Staying at a friend’s house is very fun for me, and I am pretty sure that it is fun for other people too. Usually, when my family and I go to a friend’s house, we stay up pretty late, to make the most of the trip. 


Yesterday, my family went to U.S to visit our friend’s house.The day before that day, I was really excited, because I thought there will be a lot of fun stuff happening in such party. So by the time we got to the house, I was super tired from being in the car. However, the thought of playing excited me, so I quickly went in the house and put my shoes outside near the door. 
When we were at the house, I and my brother had nothing to do, so we had played on the tablet before Megan and Makayla got home from swimming. First, it was a bit hard to get to know other people and their behaviors. However, it got more fun when we knew each other. When we played Wii, we were taking turns playing the best game, Tanks. However, we got bored of it very quickly because there was nothing to do, except playing Wii, which was also boring when you have played it a lot already. We reluctantly ate dinner, which was very good, and also one of my favorite food, Pho. We decided to play this game after dinner, where one person hides something, and all the other people have to find it. It was fun at first, and it got boring afterwards. However, on the last round Tailor touched the water in the toilet, which made everyone run including me as if we had seen a bear. Therefore, I went to another bathroom, locked the door so that nobody including Tailor could get inside. However, I was opening the door to take a peek when I saw one guy standing near Tailor. The situation quickly got over, and we played Deadman after. Finally, it was my turn to be it, and I could tell that it was super hard, finding people in a blindfold. While we were playing, our parents were making us go home, even though we wanted to play some more. They explained we had to leave earlier when we visit someone’s house in the U.S because we do not want to get to our home too late. If you like partying, perhaps you can see how much fun there was.


Staying at someone’s house is always a fun thing for me since I was born. You get to do fun stuff that you do not normally get to do in your house, such as playing Wii. However, not only staying at someone’s house is fun, but hosting your own party is also a fun experience. If I had stayed longer there at the United States, it would have been a funner experience.
