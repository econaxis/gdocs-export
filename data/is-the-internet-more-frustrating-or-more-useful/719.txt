Two years ago, I had been very excited when our family had an Internet connection before I realized the risks of having wifi. According to a study made by China researchers, wifi could cause brain damage to adolescents who overuse Internet. Therefore, a risk is involved with the usage of wifi. On the other hand, students could get access to vast resources on the Internet; and therefore, improve their education. In addition, have you ever wanted to contact with this person who is on the other half of the world? Internet makes it easier to contact people. However, overuse of Internet can cause brain damage. The Internet is very useful because it provides useful resources for students and it makes communication between people easier.
