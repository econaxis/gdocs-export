Let’s discuss:
* How Swift so masterfully got his point across – his use of rhetorical techniques is amazing! What are some of them and how did they help support the satire?
* Problems he is satiring and how his proposal was meant to solve the problems.
* Can satire work in light of social conscience?




Before we discuss Swift’s masterful use of rhetorical techniques in his essay, “A Modest Proposal,” we must first look at the effect of Swift’s unwavering commitment to maintaining a scholarly and detached tone in lieu of such a controversial and absurd idea. Swift’s scholarly tone, along with the true facts and imagery presented in the beginning, increases the reader’s receptiveness towards Swift’s later satirical ideas. This constant scholarly tone serves more than to prepare the reader, however. As I was reading through the essay, I had not realized how absurd Swift’s ideas were, primarily due to the fact that there was no significant change from when he cited basic facts to when he proposed his solution. Only halfway through did I realize that Swift’s proposal of eating infants was a totally absurd idea—and I had read it with the same attitude I had when reading the beginning. The author’s total commitment to his ideas convinces and does more to satirize his ideas than the various smaller rhetorical techniques throughout the essay.
