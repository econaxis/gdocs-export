In Asia, the teachers focus mainly on math and logic skills because they believed that most skills in life require mathematical skills. I agreed with this fact, but somehow, I felt that math was so boring! However, my father kept forcing and encouraging me to do the extra math homework, and by the time I was in grade 1, math was my favorite subject! As I progressed, my love of math transformed my way of thinking and personality. I knew how to expand and combine simple facts to solve a very complicated problem. My personality has changed from my depressed hours of learning math with my dad, now, I am very technical and prefer facts which could be expanded to concepts. 
        At home, I would identify the areas that I need to work on in order to achieve my goals.
