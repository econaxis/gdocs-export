In Asia, the teachers focus mainly on math and logic skills because they believed that most skills in life require mathematical skills. I agreed with this fact, but somehow, I felt that math was so boring! However, my father kept forcing and encouraging me to do the extra math homework, and by the time I was in grade 1, math was my favorite subject! As I progressed, my love of math transformed my way of thinking and personality. I knew how to expand and combine simple facts to solve a very complicated problem. My personality has changed from my depressed hours of learning math with my dad, now, I am very technical and prefer facts which could be expanded to concepts. 
        At home, I would identify the areas that I need to work on in order to achieve my goals. I think this is the best method for studying effectively. In addition, I understand concepts very quickly, but if I do not understand, I will do everything I can to grasp the concept. I am very good at math, and I can solve all of the problems that people present to me (so far). I love math because I love learning new things that I can use in my everyday lives. Some people do not like learning, the main reason is because they think it is boring! However, knowing the fact that someday, these new things will be used have helped me become a lifelong learner. From the time I was born to the present time, I have always been learning. I hope that I would continue learning until the time I die!
