I am just going to write about a good habit, which is reading. I hope this will promote reading, because it is just a fun, educational, and helpful thing, perhaps, reading could make people a world famous scientist! I tend to think that most people make more bad habits than good habits in their life, maybe because good habits are harder to make, or bad habits seem to suck you right in. If people do not like reading, I usually say that they should at least try a book first.
When I was in kindergarten, I did not know how to read, so I thought reading was very boring. However, my dad forced and taught me to read. The ability to read seemed so helpful (thanks to my dad) that it seemed as if I had been released into the world from a prison. I am looking back to the time I had not been able to read, I also felt as though I had been a blind child, because I could not see other things that other people could see, as I had said before.
However,                                                                                                                                                              I still did not see how reading books was that interesting, maybe because it is hard to write good stories in Vietnamese, or something else. I was quickly getting into the reading habit while I was getting better at Vietnamese. But that all changed after I came into Canada, because there were not that much Vietnamese books to read. English had also been very hard before I got used to it, so I could not read much. See how good reading is, once a book hooks you in, it is like you cannot stop reading or put the book down. Now, I would rather say that I love reading than hate it.
Reading is a very good habit to get into. If everyone loved reading and read so much that they knew everything that modern scientists know, there would be more breakthroughs in the world than ever. I wish that more people would read books and find them interesting. I also think that reading helps you in school, because you can use phrases that you really like when you read. I have used that method many times, and I have to say that it has helped me a lot.
