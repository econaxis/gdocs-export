This Gatorade ad featured in a magazine features a cold, colored bottle of Gatorade surrounded by a grey backdrop. At the first glance, this color contrast shifts the viewer’s eyes to focus on the spectacular Gatorade bottle, complete with water droplets on the side. While the pale yellow/green color of the water contrasts nicely with the monotone background, the bright orange lightning in the center of the bottle is much more striking. All of these effects complement each other to create a spectacular focus of the bottle. 


Once pathos has been established with the color contrast, the ad shifts to logos with rule of 3 and Magic Ingredients. These 3 big headlines claim water doesn’t have the magic ingredients, thus making water, supposedly, an inferior product to the Gatorade bottle advertised. Young, athletic people, the intended audience of this ad, are fairly knowledgeable on these magic ingredients, namely “carbs” and “electrolytes,” and the first 2 statements appeal to that knowledge. However, the last statement, “Water has no game,” appeals to a broader audience
