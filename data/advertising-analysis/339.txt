This Gatorade ad featured in a magazine features a cold, colored bottle of Gatorade surrounded by a grey backdrop. At the first glance, this color contrast shifts the viewer’s eyes to focus on the spectacular Gatorade bottle, complete with water droplets on the side. While the pale yellow/green color of the water contrasts nicely with the monotone background, the bright orange in the center of the bottle is much more striking.
