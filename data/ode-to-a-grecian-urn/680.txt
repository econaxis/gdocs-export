In the past, the urn might have been an important social gathering and a place of worship for many pilgrims. Keats’ “Ode on a Grecian Urn” reflects the importance and timeless nature of the urn in Keats’ society. 


Keats uses irony in the second stanza when he claims “heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard/Are sweeter,” implying that the melodies played the “soft pipes” of the urn are “sweeter” than those that appeal only to the “sensual ear.” This ironic claim supports the idea that the urn transcends above traditional “human” senses. The pursuit of the “bold lover” later in the stanza supports this idea as well. As one figuratively “chases” the other in the urn, they do not realize they are a part of generations upon generations of pilgrims who have done the same in the urn. While each generation comes to the urn for the first time, they do not realize its timeless nature. Chasing human desires is similar to the fact that “heard melodies are sweet,” but the timelessness of the urn as “Fair youth” and “Bold Lover[s]” chase “are sweeter.” 


Personification used throughout the poem serves to contrast the actions of the pilgrims and the actions of inanimate objects. As the leaves refused to “bid the Spring adieu” and as lovers “For ever panting, and for ever young” chase each other, the stone urn remains all the same. The contrast between the action of inanimate versus animate objects establish a tone of continuous action in the relatively still setting of the urn.
