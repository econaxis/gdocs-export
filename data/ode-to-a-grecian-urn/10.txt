For the group discussion for Keats, please pick one of the four poems to concentrate on. For the poem you have selected comment on the regular discussion categories. Check back in later and respond to at least one person’s posting whether it is on your chosen poem or not. I have set up discussion strings for all the poems, please start there. If you are not the first to post, then remember to respond to the most recent posting so there is a semblance of a group discussion going on.
