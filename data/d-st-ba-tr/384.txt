Everywhere, on CNN, goes the overly optimistic hippy impeacher, the activist, the fumbling host, and the old author, who all go round and round to have a turn at bashing Donald Trump. It seems as if CNN and all the other media outlets were playing 2 truths 1 lie, but instead of telling 2 truths and 1 lie, they take turns telling 1 thing they hate about Trump. Most of the time, those things are all the same. 


While the recent actions of Trump might not have elicited some anger, those who do have a voice are certainly showcasing their anger in a series of tweets, op-eds, and worst of all, TV.

What does this do? How does this help? Unless these people really believe in impeachment, then going around media ranting about Donald Trump is not going to help.
