Earth has a great variety of resources, some of which we really need, such as wood, food, vegetables, and oxygen. Earth also provides us with the resources that we do not really need, such as diamonds and gold, which we only use for fashion purposes or make our life easier. I think that in order for humans to survive, we need four things, and those items are food, water, heat, and air. However, “air” does not mean any type of air, because some of the airs are dangerous. I define “air” as oxygen. However, I will just write about water in this writing.
