The Seafarer
Like a parent scolding their child


First, the narrator is angry about the ocean. Doesn’t like the ocean. Then, laments and considers why he still maintains his job, even as “No harps ring in his heart, no rewards, No passion for women, no worldly pleasures, Nothing, only the ocean's heave.”

The Seafarer takes us along the thoughts of a desolate man at sea. The tone in The Seafarer reflects that the poem is an elegy: reminiscent and sorrowful. It begins with a sailor’s initial contempt with the sea, with its “smashing surf” and “of an anxious watch…my feet were cast in icy bands, bound with frost.” As his mourning of his own situation extends, however, the tone becomes more reflective and less focused on the sailor’s misery. He questions and seeks justification for “how often, how wearily, I put myself back on the paths of the sea.” At this point, the tone speaks less of the misery at sea, but more about god and the abstract. He finds himself, albeit his previous mournings about the struggles of sea, on yet another sea voyage: “And yet my heart wanders away, My soul roams the sea, the whales’ Home.” The poem ends with further remarks about God, with the final word “Amen.” 


The relationship between the sailor and the sea in this poem is representative of the many love-hate relationships in our lives, such as parent-children, or a person and their job. The children spend their time engulfed in their parents’ control, similar to how the sailor is “drifting through winter on an ice-cold sea, whirled in sorrow,” unable to control the sea’s temperament. As the children distance themselves away from their parents, however, the children find themselves ever more attracted to the same parents that they had despised before. The same thing happens in The Seafarer, as the sailor has an urge to be on the sea again. Just as a sailor needs a sea, despite its misery, a child needs a parent, despite their rules and punishments.
