American Media, Terrorists, and their Secret Alliance


First, we need to ask ourselves this question: What do terrorists want? Terrorism is certainly not a full fledged political ideology like Socialism or Anarchism; it is rather a tactic used by smaller, often extremist, groups to push their ideologies forward into bigger states, like the US. It could also be thought of as a rather extreme form of missionary work, to force extremist Islamic ideals into the Western world. 


The media

Effects of the 24 hour news cycle


What capitalism and an innate greed for money does to television (corrupt it) (adds fear)

Research/statistics showing:
        Fear levels before and after 9/11
        Fear that is caused by the media, mostly television
        Why such high fear?
        Refer to paragraphs above and say high fear, because it makes viewers keep watching
        
Effects this has later on
        Could be why US government it so strict for safety
        Turned people’s attention away from other important issues, like healthcare, infrastructure
        The media basically amplified whatever effect the terror attacks were having.
