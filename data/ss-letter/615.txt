Dear Father,


The railway construction has definitely sped up since the new manager Van Horne arrived. Equipment and goods are moving in and out much more quickly, and more men are put to work than ever, with no one having time to idle around. There are flat sections where we lay track quickly and easily without tiring much. But there are also hilly sections where we have to zig zag treacherous ways down the mountain. Construction around this area is very dangerous and there are numerous casualties of men every day. Unsurprisingly, I don’t see these injured men ever again, but more young men to come in to replace them. They are often reckless and suffer the same injuries as the ones they were sent to replace.


The wages are not very good—barely enough to pay for my own room and board. I still have it better than many others who are not able-bodied men, who struggle for days without jobs and cannot participate in the grand railway project. Hopefully, once completed, this railway will pull Canada out of this recession and create many more jobs. Free trade and a new fertile Western area connected by railway will certainly do wonders for our economy. 


During the winter months, we work less but still pay the same amount for room and board. Cold conditions leaves our bodies feeling rigid, and the hard bunks and leaking ceilings do nothing to alleviate our discomforts. Food is horrible and pay is barely enough to cover our living expenses. Sometimes, it might be the same cold sludge for days on end, which made our stomach moods variable and toilet trips less than comfortable. 


The gifts and cookies you sent me were very good and lifted my spirits from a long day of work. Our spirits are always high when the mail car arrives. Looking forward to our next letter.
