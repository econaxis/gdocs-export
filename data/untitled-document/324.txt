Lines 1 - 16
Thomas Gray uses lines 1 to 16 to describe the setting of the church where the funeral for whom the elegy is for is taking place. The melancholic mood of these lines is accomplished primarily by the slow, constant rhythm and Gray’s diction. For example, the words “curfew,” “parting day,” “lowing herd,” and “plods his weary way” all concentrated in the first stanza contribute to a sense of a melancholic dusk. In addition to the slow rhythmic pace, Gray also uses an ABAB rhyme in each of his stanzas, marking even more of a sense of repetition and melancholy.
Gray ends this section by talking about the dead below him who lay in “a moldering heap.”


Lines 17-28
These lines primarily serve to recall the lively moments in each of these people who laid in “a moldering heap,” suggesting their irreversible death and recounting the lively moments of their lives.
