Transportation has always been a problem to us after we had inhabited this Earth. Even now, where the technology that we have now has evolved many times, we still have problems for transportation. However, our forms of transportation have improved a lot in the recent years. At the time where cavemen, Cro-Magnons, mammoths were still roaming the planet, there had been different problems to transportation, but as technology evolves, old problems are solved, but new problems pop up as if there were countless problems. I hope that humans will be free of problems in transportation someday. 


Everyday, tankers and supertankers travel across the ocean to deliver. However, their traffic is becoming much bigger.  A new report says that the risk of oil tankers entering and exiting the British Columbia coast has a risk that is higher than previously predicted. If you are curious about how an oil spill affects BC, take a ride on one of the ferries that take the route that more than two hundred other supertankers take. The route takes over twelve hours and bypasses some of the deepest wilderness in the country, possibly on the planet.
