Lines 1 - 16
Thomas Gray uses lines 1 to 16 to describe the setting of the church where the funeral for whom the elegy is for is taking place. The melancholic mood of these lines is accomplished primarily by the slow, constant rhythm and Gray’s diction. For example, the words “curfew,” “parting day,” “lowing herd,” and “plods his weary way” all concentrated in the first stanza contribute to a sense of a melancholic dusk. In addition to the slow rhythmic pace, Gray also uses an ABAB rhyme in each of his stanzas, marking even more of a sense of repetition and melancholy.
Gray ends this section by talking about the dead below him who lay in “a moldering heap.”


Lines 17-28
These lines primarily serve to recall the lively moments in each of these people who laid in “a moldering heap,” suggesting their irreversible death and recounting the lively moments of their lives. The diction in these lines are in stark contrast to the melancholic and almost depressing diction of the previous lines—the words “blazing hearth,” “breezy call,” and “shrill clarion” along with the lively memories in lines 21 to 28 make the mood much more lighter.


Imagery is also evident throughout this poem to give the readers the sense of joy of when “children run to lisp their sire’s return, or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.” The brief moment of reminiscent happiness surrounded by the depressing nature of this elegy gives an interesting mood to these specific lines.


Lines 29-44


Gray writes almost as if chastising his society’s “boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,” and seems to have taken interest in “the short and simple annals of the poor” as he realizes how short-lived living life is. His attitude towards the wealthy and noble—a class Gray is deeply embedded in—is even more evident as he poses the rhetorical question, “Can Honor’s voice provoke the silent dust, Or Flattery soothe the dull cold ear of Death?” Perhap, Gray is regretting his obsession with wealth and nobility, and upon a close encounter of the death of his friend, realizes poor and wealth all lead to the same path: death.


Lines 45- 76
Gray’s main argument in these lines is that poor people are not somehow “worse” than the wealthy, citing examples from nature as “Full many a gem of purest ray serene,” yet hidden under the “dark unfathomed caves of ocean.” 
Line 77 - 92
These lines are a continuation to Gray’s praise of poor people. He emphasizes that no matter one’s wealth, everybody is at basic, the same. Even though the people underneath the churchyard in which he sits on is poor, they still value remembering the dead with “some frail memorial still erected nigh.”
