2. How do you want to be recognized?                         /30
        I want to be recognized as a confident individual who realizes that whatever I set my mind to, I can do. While fear, anxiety, and most oftenly laziness sometimes prevents me from accomplishing my goals, I am working towards a point where I have the confidence to know that if I want something done, I can get it done. I don’t want to be seen as someone who is more than capable of accomplishing their goals but chooses not to do so in fear of failure. I want to be someone who shows my confidence through success rather than arrogance.                                                           /10
        There are loads of successful people who are caught up in their success and essentially, burn the ladder away after they have climbed it. While I am nowhere close to calling myself successful, I hope to remain kind and be recognized as a kind person wherever I go. Kindness and simply a willingness to help others regardless is what I hope defines me, and what I want to be recognized by others. Success without kindness means little in the way of actual results--what can I say I have done to the world with a boatload of money but no kindness to share?                     /10
        I also want to be recognized as extremely curious about everything in life. Our unending curiosity is what keeps us human and different from animals. I want to be seen as something who is curious at everything and puts this curiosity to good use. My curious attitude will also help me in all my school courses as it is curiosity that drives learning, rather than the pressure of test scores. If I want to go into a research-oriented field later on, curiosity will be very important as it will motivate me to work and ensure that I am genuinely interested in my work. In addition, curiosity will allow me to be a more interesting person instead of being solely interested in myself.                                                               /10

3. What do you see as your greatest strengths?        /30
        Science and math are my greatest strengths as I have much experience studying these subjects and also equally passionate. I find them interesting, and the more confusing the subject matter, the more ‘agitated’ I become to understand it. I have never found myself struggling in these classes, which is one clear sign that I am strong at these subjects. I plan to continue studying science or math in university and make use of these strengths that I have developed early on. If I continue to be passionate about these subjects, then hopefully I can use my strengths to do the things I am passionate about.         The first textbook I had ever read was Math Makes Sense. After that, was a chemistry textbook “The Central Science,” then “Organic Chemistry.” After every textbook, I became more and more curious in the sciences, for many reasons.        /10
        I would also consider writing to be one of my strengths. I tend to write very fast and most oftenly, ideas would flow through my head very quickly. Combined with my love for creativity and fondness for writing, I think I can go far with my writing skills. If I maintain my current passion and love for writing, this skill will certainly open up many doors for me that skill and knowledge alone wouldn’t have been enough. Writing is different from the sciences because the process is very fluid, and there is no “right answer.” Although I had hated writing at an early age, encouragement from teachers spurred me on to write more, and consequently, love it as a passion.                /10
        I also consider computer programming to be a strength. I first started experimenting with computers at around 12 years old with an old computer, and found the “magic” fascinating. However, I wasn’t really passionate about it until I grew older and my math skills developed—until then, I wasn’t “smart” enough to understand the concepts of computer science. Once I had understood it, however, computer science felt even more magical. Hours of working on a problem only to have it somehow play out correctly on the computer is more than worth the effort and very satisfying.                         /10
