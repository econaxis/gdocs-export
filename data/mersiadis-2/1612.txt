2. How do you want to be recognized?                         /60
        I want to be recognized as a confident individual who realizes that whatever I set my mind to, I can do. While fear, anxiety, and most oftenly laziness sometimes prevents me from accomplishing my goals, I am working towards a point where I have the confidence to know that if I want something done, I can get it done. I don’t want to be seen as someone who is more than capable of accomplishing their goals but chooses not to do so in fear of failure. I want to be someone who shows my confidence through success rather than arrogance.                                                                     /10
        There are loads of successful people who are caught up in their success and essentially, burn the ladder away after they have climbed it. While I am nowhere close to calling myself successful, I hope to remain kind and be recognized as a kind person wherever I go. Kindness and simply a willingness to help others regardless is what I hope defines me, and what I want to be recognized by others. Success without kindness means little in the way of actual results--what can I say I have done to the world with a boatload of money but no kindness to share?                     /10
        Confidence and kindness are perhaps the simplest recipe to success in my opinion. Life, however, is not just about climbing ladder after ladder of careers. Charisma will fulfill the social aspects of my life. Nobody likes downbeat pessimistic person, regardless of their success or kindness. Charisma will allow me to inspire others and have fun in life. Pessimism and downright being “boring” will shut off many doors that will otherwise have opened simply by being optimistic. Optimism and charisma is arguably the easiest thing to “be” in this list, but I still have long ways to go.                                                                                   /10
3. What do you see as your greatest strengths?
        Science and math are my greatest strengths as I have much experience studying these subjects and also equally passionate. I find them interesting, and the more confusing the subject matter, the more ‘agitated’ I become to understand it. I have never found myself struggling in these classes, which is one clear sign that I am strong at these subjects. I plan to continue studying science or math in university and make use of these strengths that I have developed early on. If I continue to be passionate about these subjects, then hopefully I can use my strengths to do the things I am passionate about.               /10
        I would also consider writing to be one of my strengths. I tend to write very fast and most oftenly, ideas would flow through my head very quickly. Combined with my love for creativity and fondness for writing, I think I can go far with my writing skills. If I maintain my current passion and love for writing, this skill will certainly open up many doors for me that skill and knowledge alone wouldn’t have been enough.                                                                         /10
        I also consider computer programming to be a strength. I first started experimenting with computers at around 12 years old with an old computer, and found the “magic” fascinating. However, I wasn’t really passionate about it until I grew older and my math skills developed—until then, I wasn’t “smart” enough to understand the concepts of computer science. Once I had understood it, however, computer science felt even more magical. Hours of working on a problem only to have it somehow play out correctly on the computer is more than worth the effort and very satisfying.                         /10
