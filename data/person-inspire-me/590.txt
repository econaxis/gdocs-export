There are many great people out there that have shaped the world. However, we also have to pay attention to the smaller group of people that also have made an impact on the world, too. I am mainly inspired by people who are generous and would do anything to improve other’s lives, but not inspired by greedy billionaires that use the money only for themselves. I am mainly inspired by Salman Khan because of his passions and determination to change the way learning works. The way he presents information in an encouraging voice will definitely boost a student’s understanding of a certain subject. Salman Khan is a great and smart person, who puts education and people over profit.
