There are many great people out there that have shaped the world. I am mainly inspired by people who are generous and would do anything to improve other’s lives, but am not inspired by greedy millionaires that use the money only for themselves. Salman Khan perfectly fitted my perception of a great person because of his passions and determination to change the way learning works. The way he presents information in an encouraging voice will definitely boost a student’s understanding of a certain subject. I was also moved by the way he said good-bye to his profitable job and started devoting his life to Khan Academy, a non-profit website for people who want to learn.
        Throughout my whole life, my dream was to go to the top universities in the world and get a good job. On the other hand, I did not want to be the greedy rich people that used their money just for themselves and do not contribute a lot to society. Salman Khan perfectly fitted those conditions, so I looked forward to be him when I grew up. Another thing that made me inspire him was because he graduated from two very good universities:MIT and Harvard. Those two were my dream schools and I would do anything to be accepted into one of those universities. I believed that if I could get in, then I would be very respected and would have a very happy life.
