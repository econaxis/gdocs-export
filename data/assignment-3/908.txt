        There is a $150 billion dollar industry whose sole purpose is to make you stupid and scared. It’s not horror publishing or the silly movies that come and go. It’s television. Yes—the Simpsons reruns, courtroom dramas, childish cartoons, and, 24 hour news.


Nut graf:
        Television has veered from its original purpose of being a public informant to a scary ratings-obsessed monster—one that we voluntarily tune into for 5 hours every day. What could happen if we hear the same cynical maniac ranting about a possible world war or how illegal immigrants are stealing their jobs for 5 straight hours? After the maniac voice ranting about America’s urgent need for a border wall penetrates our thoughts for days on end, we actually start to believe the maniac. And when we resign our mental barriers after a long day at work, or when sitting in evening rush hour traffic, then it becomes easier to blindly accept what the maniac voice says than to think. This is how over 50% of America came to support building a giant wall as a solution to a problem that plagues all levels of America: from top politicians to country farmers, from CEOs to minimum-wage workers.




Ideas for the rest of the article: 
        The rest of the article will detail the effects of TV, and how it has transformed completely sane populations to one that supports absurd, albeit grand, solutions. This will look at the contemporary examples (such as the above-mentioned border wall), but will also examine past events (such as paranoia about terrorism following 9/11).
