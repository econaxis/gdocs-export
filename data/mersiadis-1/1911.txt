1. What are you passionate about?
Every day, a Shakespeare bikes through unkept roads to a place he shouldn’t be in and does work he shouldn’t do. Another Einstein sweeps the streets of his parent’s street side food stall and serves cheap food when he should have been gossiping about his teachers and doing homework. These Einsteins and Shakespeares of third-world countries don’t have easily accessible scholarships, “gifted programs” to guide their passions, nor coaches or mentors to help them. I am passionate to make free education a universal human right, because this right is not just a right to books or education or to a teacher—it is a right to succeed in life. 
I am also passionate about saving lives. I want to be a doctor when I grow up and use my hands and the scalpel to fix problems. There is currently a massive shortage of doctors, which means many people who have paid for their healthcare through taxes and contributions are not able to receive the healthcare they deserve. While the path towards being a doctor is long, tiring, and expensive, my goal and unwavering passion towards helping people live better lives will carry me through medical school, residency, and beyond. While I will be only one of many helping to alleviate the doctor shortage and a huge list of patients, I am passionate to make a real difference in the lives of people. 
I am also passionate about sports in general. I play a lot of sports, none at a particularly high level but my goal is not to attain that level. My goal is not to be “high-level” at sports, only to be good enough so my enjoyment of the sport is always greater than the hard work necessary to improve myself. Of course, with that self-imposed limitation, I cannot improve to a very high level. However, I am somehow still passionate. Every winter, I would go skiing for at least five days in Whistler, and every season I would try to try the harder runs or the icier one. Elite level ski racers race pass me on the slopes I struggle to keep my knees steady on, but that doesn’t keep me from enjoying the sport. I play volleyball, tennis, badminton, and many other types of sports. I play for the sake of fun, not to get a better physique or to “improve myself.”
