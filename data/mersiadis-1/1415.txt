1. What are you passionate about?
Every day, a Shakespeare bikes through unkept roads to a place he shouldn’t be in and does work he shouldn’t do. Another Einstein sweeps the streets of his parent’s street side food stall and serves cheap food when he should have been gossiping about his teachers and doing homework. These Einsteins and Shakespeares of third-world countries don’t have easily accessible scholarships, “gifted programs” to guide their passions, nor coaches or mentors to help them. Free education should be a human right—the right to succeed is essential to every part of the human experience, and to deny someone’s right to succeed is absolutely inhumane.
The answer to why African or poor Asian countries have much less Nobel Prize winners or academics than Western countries is simple. If you had put Einstein or Shakespeare or Newton in an African country and set them to work mining or farming at age 5, our textbooks today would be much thinner. Conversely, if we take the hundreds of Einsteins and Shakespeares in third-world countries and put them into Western schools, our textbooks today would be much more thicker. Free, universal education affects more than the refugees and poor people we see on daily 6 PM news—it affects every one of us. The longer we delay the right to succeed to these successful, passionate people, the slower and more unproductive our world will be.
Free education on a universal scale cannot be accomplished by individuals. Nations working together will accomplish this noble goal, but individuals are nonetheless very important. I am first focusing on this problem locally by helping teach kids writing. Although these kids are in no way devoid of opportunities, it is my step towards this noble goal. I am also trying to apply for another position helping low-income high school dropouts get their degree.
