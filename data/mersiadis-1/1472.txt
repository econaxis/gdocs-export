1. What are you passionate about?
Every day, a Shakespeare bikes through unkept roads to a place he shouldn’t be in and does work he shouldn’t do. Another Einstein sweeps the streets of his parent’s street side food stall and serves cheap food when he should have been gossiping about his teachers and doing homework. These Einsteins and Shakespeares of third-world countries don’t have easily accessible scholarships, “gifted programs” to guide their passions, nor coaches or mentors to help them. I am passionate to make free education a universal human right, because this right is not just a right to books or education or to a teacher—it is a right to succeed in life.
