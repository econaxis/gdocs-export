1. What are you passionate about?
Every day, a Shakespeare bikes through unkept roads to a place he shouldn’t be in and does work he shouldn’t do. Another Einstein sweeps the streets of his parent’s street side food stall and serves cheap food when he should have been gossiping about his teachers and doing homework. These Einsteins and Shakespeares of third-world countries don’t have easily accessible scholarships, “gifted programs” to guide their passions, nor coaches or mentors to help them. I am passionate to make free education a universal human right, because this right is not just a right to books or education or to a teacher—it is a right to succeed in life. 








A ball is thrown straight up from the edge of the roof of a building. A second ball is dropped from the roof 1.00 seconds later (ignore air resistance).
(a) If the height of the building is 20.00 meters, what must be the initial speed of the first ball if both are to hit the ground at the same time?
(b) Consider the same situation, but now let the initial speed of the first ball be given and treat the height of the of the building as an unknown. What would the height of the height of the building for both balls to reach the ground at the same time?
