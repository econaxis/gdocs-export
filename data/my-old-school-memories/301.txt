People always have memories good or bad. Everyone should remember all of their memories, which is pretty hard if it occurred when you were very young and now you are very old. I think a good habit to do to remember all of these great memories is writing in your journal. That way, you can put all of the bad things that had happened to you in a piece of paper and not worry about it.
