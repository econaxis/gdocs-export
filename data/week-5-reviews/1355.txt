21st century education


I recently got the chance to see a new middle school in Vancouver which seeks to deviate itself from the traditional closed walls of classrooms and the monotone of hallways. The school opts, instead, for open hallways and clear glass classrooms and an emphasis on student interactions rather than memorization, claiming that they enhance learning. 


As part of an internship program, I could essentially “shadow” one of the teachers for the whole of September/November. The first few days were interesting enough: I could see how encouraging  student interactions could allow them to benefit. The entirety of the first week was the teachers praising the new education system and how much fun they planned for the students, which was understandable considering how new and enthusiastic the teachers were supposed to be. 


The next week was a plethora of assemblies and the same echo chamber of how lucky the students were to be in this “beautiful school.” At the beginning of every assembly, the principal would acknowledge, with great genuinity, that this school was situated on “traditionally unsettled Musqueam land.” She would then invite an aboriginal student to repeat the same fact, except coupled with even more stutters and uhms and redundant rephrasings of the same idea. I got the message that they were dedicated to the aboriginal awareness cause, but whether the teachers taught anything about First Nations still remains a question, even after 2 months of shadowing them.


I got the impression that this was the perfect environment complemented by the perfect educational system--it would allow gifted kids to succeed and bring fun back to learning for all the other students. The idea was noble, but the execution still leaves lots to be desired. When typical rowdy teenagers get thrown from a world of tight control to a world of freedom,
