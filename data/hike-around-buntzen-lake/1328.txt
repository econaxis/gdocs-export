Hike Around Buntzen Lake
There are many places to enjoy the lush greenery of BC while also exercising the body on the hikes. A mix of both, the Buntzen Lake Trail, followed by the Diez Vistas Trail, have a mix of both, offering great sites and ample places to test one’s balance while the steep cliffs use every opportunity to trip us as we hopelessly slid down the hills. Luckily, after being jostled around like flour, we were lucky to escape the deceptive mountains and the steep cliffs that weakened us until all of our body parks hurted like never before.
After walking the first half of the trail, we ate lunch. After I had finished my subway bread my mother made, I started taking pictures of the beautiful Buntzen Lake. Applying what I had learned from the things I learned about photography at home, I took a landscape picture of Buntzen Lake. It looked good, but I still preferred to make some adjustments that would have been possible if I had the heavy and robust camera at home, instead of the little iPhone camera. Then, I sat walked around, waiting for my other family members to finish their lunch. Then, I checked the GPS, and saw that we would have to climb over 100 meters in just 150 meters of trail. I realized that the trail would have to be very steep, almost 40 degrees.
