“Failure is impossible” - Susan B. Anthony
Failure is impossible, but in today’s terms, when we say “I failed”, it means something more negative than the true meaning that “failure” possesses. Nowadays, when we say “we fail”, it means that we were unsuccessful in completing the task. However, we did not fail, because we progressed in our ability to do that task successfully. Nowadays, people immediately think of failure as being bad, insufficient, and unsatisfactory.  Many people do not recognize that sometimes, failing at a task may have more benefit than succeeding at it, because then, we develop and have more experience in the skill. The benefits that failure gives us can be easily forgotten because it is not tangible, and we cannot immediately recognize the effects.
One very distinct example where failing is considered to be very bad is in the seasonal school report card. Many parents will be very disappointed at their child with an F in his or her report card. Teachers also define the infamous “F” as very bad. In this case, sometimes, receiving an F is not good, but it is a good time for reflection. However, when we get a good grade and are overconfident with ourselves, we forget the reflection part, and instantly move on to the next topic that life provides us. This sometimes leads to a weak foundation in the later years.  I have had many occurrences with this fact, where I feel very overconfident with myself for good marks, but later realized that I had not fully yet mastered the subject that I was feeling so overconfident not too long ago.
However, despite all of the benefits that failure gives us, sometimes, it can lead to devastating effects. Many people will immediately feel disappointed with themselves when they fail, and they may even stop trying to improve. Then, instead of all of the reflection and improvement, this type of reaction to failure can stop any improvement, and their skill may even decrease.
