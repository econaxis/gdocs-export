What is Kindlers Society?
Kindlers Society is a non-profit organization founded and run by high school students. Empowered by the crippling poverty affecting many communities abroad and on her very own streets in Vancouver, Candice Wong recognized the need for accessible education. With the aid of like-mindedly dedicated and passionate young people, she began one of the largest youth-run non-profit organizations in Canada.
What has Kindlers accomplished?
With over 500 active members across the Lower Mainland and partners across the globe, Kindlers Society has shipped tens of thousands of educational resources to schools in need. Believing in the life changing impact of quality education, we promote English literacy through salvaging quality unwanted books that would be otherwise discarded. Consequently, entire communities gain access to libraries where the simple gift of stories can have an unfathomable impact.
