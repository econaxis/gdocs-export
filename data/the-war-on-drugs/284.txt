In June 1971, Richard Nixon declared a war on a disease that had plagued over 2 million Americans, and like cancer, this disease stems from a betrayal of one’s own body. President Nixon had aggrandized this disease as “public enemy number one,” and smeared the victims of it as criminals. The disease is not one that is met with compassion and sympathy, as President Nixon’s campaign has tainted it as a crime, its victims as criminals, and its symptoms as the epitome of failure. This disease is drug abuse.
