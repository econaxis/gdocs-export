A world where everybody watches television
TV is fear mongering/ sensational
Politics is like boxing match — people come not to get information but for entertainment


Story of a “normal man” with a clever child 
Man goes to watch sensational TV everyday after long day of work — makes him susceptible to any “propaganda” the government gives.


Set in a time of an election, show presidential debate: roasting, punching, fighting, not talking about politics, and crowd cheering. Exactly like a boxing match. Narrator very excited to go.
In the end- learned nothing about the 2 candidates. 
Show 2 candidates: one loud, boisterous, proposing big, grand solutions (like the Wall), while the other is more reserved, proposing small solutions
Crowd cheering for big solutions
Some motto that they keep chanting


Comes home to watch TV 
Hears reports of migrants coming in floods—TV
Gets mad—wants a wall
Close-minded
Hates the migrants even more
        Very tired — listens and absorbs what fear/anger TV gives


The Courier
Reports facts, numbers
Headline that contradicts with his view (e.g. Border wall budget even higher), (Police are searching the wrong group of people), 
I threw the paper down in disgust. Who’d bother to read the dreary Courier articles when we’d have the Border Wall to protect us?


The son
        Beginning—doubts the border wall (dialogue—utter stupidity of the border wall)
                Portray child as very clever, see pasts sensationalism and drama
        Reads the Courier, gets scolded by his dad (narrator) for reading something pointless
