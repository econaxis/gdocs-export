Is pleasing everybody the key to success?


        Pleasing everybody is not the key to success, but in fact, the key to failure. We time and time again refer to Aesop’s fable about the young boy, his father, and a donkey, who traveled together as they began their quest to please everybody that they meet. It is just simply impossible to accommodate every individual’s ideas and beliefs; the idea is to stick with OUR own belief, then we will be more successful. 
        It is virtually impossible to please everybody that we meet, and it is even more impossible to please everybody in the world. If we even try a little bit to do that, we would end up accomplishing nothing or very little at all. For example, my brother’s friend Aiish  was a very playful person. He played tennis a lot and often very invited my brother to play with him as well. However, his teachers and his parents and his guardians also expected him to do very well academically. Therefore, if he sacrificed his teacher’s and his parent’s expectations for his own, which were being good at tennis and having a healthy lifestyle, then he would anger them.
