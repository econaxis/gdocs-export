We all know that farmers are very important because they grow food for you and me. But the question is can they grow it for everyone? Well, it depends on the types of food. If it is a fast-spreading and fast-growing food, then sure, maybe they can do that. Now, let the real story start.
While I was eating my food, I was not thinking about the hard effort that farmers have put in to make the food. [a]According to my opinions, farmers are growing fruits and things that vegetarians [b]eat less than growing livestock, which is bad. If all the people in our world were all vegetarians, we would be much more healthy than today[c]. Now, let’s start talking about eating vegetarian, that means no intaking meat and fish. The number one reason why we should start eating vegetarian is because we do not hurt the animals by not killing them. The second reason that is also very important is that the endangered species do not get killed by poachers. but doing all of what we have just talked about is an extremely hard thing to do, but very effective for the farming industry. Can we encourage farmers to abandon their livestock and turn that land for growing crops? I do not think so. If they do not agree with us and continue to [d]grow livestock, then we will just have to leave them alone, so what I would do is to make farms grow crops of my own. However, it is not always possible abandon livestock inside farms because some of the things that we usually eat or drink (milk, eggs, et cetera) are made by animals. I have thought that a vegetarian [e]is less healthier than a person who eats both meat and vegetables. Well, vegetarians do not get as much proteins as a person who eats meat but because they eat so many vegetables, they get more nutrients. As you can see, farmers have played a very important role in[f] our lives and for the world for over 100 years. Therefore, you should respect farmers by just saying thank you to them or whatever way you can think of. I had thought that farmers were not hardworking for a long time before I got older.[g] Farmers have been[h] helping us for a long time but we do not care about their hard work, we just eat the food made by them.
I think it is possible for farmers to grow enough food for everyone in the world if they figure out some plan to increase their production, other than using chemicals that accommodate growth. Once again, farmers are very hardworking and determined, so I hope these two things will help encourage farmers to grow more crops instead of livestock. However, if the increasing production thing encourages farmers to use more chemicals, then that is a bad thing. For me, chemicals that increase growth are like drugs to farmers, they help the farmers get more money, but they harm the environment and your health. Which is not fair because while these farmers were prospering, you were getting sick and stuff.[i]
