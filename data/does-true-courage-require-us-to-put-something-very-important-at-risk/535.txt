Does true courage require to put something very important to us at risk?
        Courage is doing something that we may not have to necessarily do, but we want to do it, even though it may not even benefit us at all. It is facing difficulties that we can just leave, facing challenges that we don’t have to complete. It is not the preferred thing to do, and not everyone wants to do it. Courage is doing something that is very easy to fail, but we do it, regardless of the risks that we may have to face. We can only have true courage when we have sacrificed something that we have cherished for something, even though that “thing” may not even be better.
        Courage includes sacrifices, risks, and failures, but without them, it is not courage because there are none of those factors, or stimuli, that makes achieving courage so hard and difficult. If we don’t have anything important to us at risk, then the action we are doing is not courage, because there is no probability that we may fail.
