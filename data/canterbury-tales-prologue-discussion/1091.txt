I think the most despicable character in The Canterbury Tales would be the Prioress. While the description of her mostly paints a clean picture of the Prioress as a gentle, loving princess, a closer inspection reveals that the Prioress’s “courtly” behaviour is nothing more than a mask. The lines “She wolde weepe if that she saw a mous,” and “hir over-lippe wiped she so clene/that in hir coppe ther was no ferthing seene” reiterate her perfect manners and gentle character. It seems as if, throughout the whole description, the Prioress lacks any despicable qualities—she is perfect in almost every way. However, that seeming “perfectness” is what makes her despicable. She would weep if she saw a mouse, “deed or bledde,” a courtly thing to do, but readily gives her dogs “rosted flessh.” If we also consider that she is a nun, then her extravagance and harsh cleanliness seems less appealing. A nun is supposed to devote her time to praying, yet, we see none of praying in the Prioress’s description.


Chaucer is satirizing, perhaps, the church’s corruption in that period, as many of the characters held roles in a church or were associated with the church (Friar, Prioress, Monk, Summoner, …), but rarely did any of them “follow” their supposed role. For example, the Friar exploited his job to seduce young women and garner as much money from the unsuspecting, “For thogh a wydwe hadde noght a sho/So plesaunt was his in principio/Yet wolde he have a ferthyng, er he wente.” Chaucer invented all of these characters to perhaps show how the church wasn’t the most effective at that period.




Favorite Character
My favorite character in The Canterbury Tales must be the Franklin, simply because of his genuine generosity and hospitality. He welcomes everyone to feast at his house, regardless of their race
