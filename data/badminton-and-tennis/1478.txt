When I was still in grade 3, my father taught and played tennis with me and my brother when we did not have anything to do. Since I also played badminton, I did not know that I would have to use almost all of my strength to hit the tennis ball to the other half of the court. After a year of both playing tennis and badminton, I realized that badminton and tennis are two very different sports, although they do have some similarities. 
        Badminton, unlike tennis, has more strategy and is more tiring to play. In badminton, players who are the same in skill would have to use strategy and tactics in order to win. Some of the strategies that are used in badminton include tiring your opponent out. Tiring out the opponent is a strategy that many players use when they can see that the rally will last for a very long time. Making him run and increasing the pace of the game are the main ways to make the opponent tired.. In tennis, it is very hard to tire your opponent out and it does not has as many ways to win using strategy. In badminton, players often have to move around and dive for shots. Instead, in tennis, players have time to hit their shot, so they do not become as tired and do not need a super fast reaction to win the rally. 
        Despite these similarities, badminton and tennis also have some differences. They have the same variation of play, doubles and singles. In badminton doubles, one persons stays in the front while the other person stays in the back. In tennis, it is basically the same thing.
