Has always appealed to me
Watched the news almost everyday


It was during the hot Vietnamese evening of  September 11, 2009, that I remembered fuzzily. I had plumped down on the couch and roamed my hands for the remote, finally relieved that it was the end to a long school day. I settled down to watch Nickelodeon, but my dad quickly switched to MSNBC, and said “Watch this. It’s scary.” I had already started tuning out once I saw the typical rolling headlines at the bottom and the indistinguishable face of the reporter, but then an airplane streaked across the screen and crashed into one of the towers. I looked among the smoke to find the inevitable superhero that would emerge out, or an explosion of some sorts. None—only clouds after clouds of smoke. Then, like any other 5 year old kid would, I tuned out, but still kept one eye on the screen in case any superhero would enter. I switched the channel back to Nickelodeon after my dad left. 


Now that I watch the MSNBC replays of 9/11, a wave of nostalgia washes over me.
