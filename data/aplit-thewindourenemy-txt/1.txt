# The Wind Our Enemy: Tone


## Section III


#### Tone: Reminiscing:
+ **Imagery**: “The wheat was embroidering...frail threads needled by sunshine like thin gold.”
+ **Hyperbole**: “Its broad spread promising all his granaries might hold.” 
+ **Metaphor**: “A woman’s eyes could kiss the soil.” 
+ **Aside**: (Line 35), “(Two-ninety-eight, Sale Catalogue).” Browsing the Sale Catalogue—back when they had money or luxuries.


#### Tone: Despair: 
+ **Imagery**: (Lines 36-40) As if the author was praying that the drought would be over. 
+ **Ellipsis**: (Line 40) Suggest that the “hot hand scorching flesh” and “soldered to the earth by horizon of glare” would not end. 
+ **Setting**: (Lines 42-43) Author’s word choice gives a mood of despair: “heavy scraping” “dried out-everywhere-“


## Section IV
#### Tone: Cynical
+ **Irony**: 
        + (Lines 44-46) The author shows their statements (“It’ll rain next year!”) in contrast to her description of the drought.
        + “*Sickly-familiar* saying...”, “‘Just the empties goin’ back!’” (sarcastic optimism). 


## Section VI
#### Tone: Resigned
+ **Dialogue/Narration**: From lines 86-93, only discussion of problem, with no notion of a solution. 
+ **Diction**: “Trudge away...half-empty lard-pails...shiver in the schoolhouse (unpainted seven years).” Word choice paints a negative picture with no attempt at trying to remedy the problems.
+ **Repetition**: The word “_relief_” in lines 86, 88, 94, as if suffocating the reader. Suggest they were resigned before line 94 (“_Relief cars._”), but the mood only lightens after help arrives.
