Inquiry: Motion of a Falling Ball
 
Purpose
To determine the period of the ticker-tape timer, then, using the period, to determine the time-distance graph of a falling ball. With the graph, we can determine the maximum instantaneous speed and average speed of the falling ball.
 
Theory
The period of the ticker tape is determined by five trials with two outliers excluded. The total length of time of the three trials divided by the total number of ticks gives us 0.01825 s/tick.

The speed of a falling ball in ideal conditions is characterized by the equation  $$V=\frac{dD}{dt}=9.8t$$, where t is time in seconds and D is distance. Integrating this equation with respect to $$t$$ gives us $$D=4.9t^2+C$$, where C can be assumed to be 0. Thus, the ball’s distance from starting point in meters at any time can be determined by the expression $$4.9t^2$$.

Procedure
1. Run a strip of paper through the ticker tape for about 1.5s, recording the time and count of ticks.
2. Repeat step 1 two more times to obtain an average period by dividing the total length of time by total count of ticks.
3. Tape a tennis ball to one end of the paper tape and slide it through the slits of the ticker tape timer.
4. Drop the tennis ball, making sure to stop the ticker tape timer before the ball touches the ground. Record the length of time the timer runs.
5. Record the distance each successive dot is from the starting point on the paper. Plot the distance with each point’s respective time (determined from the period).

Calculations
 
The average speed of the falling ball over 0 to 0.402 s is given by the formula $$\frac{Distance}{Time}=\frac{0.7498}{0.4015}= 1.8675 m/s$$. 


The maximum instantaneous speed can be calculated either by using the derivative of the quadratic regression or estimated with the slope of the chord connecting the last two data points. 


The derivative of $$y=3.8203x^2+0.3432x$$ at $$x=0.4015$$ is $$3.0677 m/s$$. Thus, the maximum instantaneous speed of the falling ball is 3.0677 m/s, which was right before we stopped the ticker tape timer. 
Without using the quadratic regression, we could also estimate the maximum instantaneous speed by calculating the slope of the chord connecting the last two data points, given by the following equation. 
$$\frac{y_1−y_2}{x_1−x_2}=\frac{0.74980−0.69587}{0.4015−0.3833}=2.995$$ This value is less than the value calculated using the quadratic trendline as the slope of the chord is less than the slope of the tangent line. 


Results


We calculated the average speed of the falling ball over the time interval 0-0.4015s to be $$1.8675 \frac{m}{s^2}$$, and the instantaneous maximum speed to be $$3.0677 \frac{m}{s^2}$$$$. $$


From this information, we can calculate the gravitational constant, $$g$$, defined as $$g=\frac{V}{t}=\frac{2D}{t^2}$$. From our results, the calculated gravitational constant is $$9.3026 \frac{m}{s^2}$$.


Conclusion


With the following results, we conclude that our calculated gravitational constant of $$9.3026 \frac{m}{s^2}$$ is close to the accepted value of $$9.81 \frac{m}{s^2}$$. 


This experiment could be made better by setting the ticker tape timer on a higher surface and letting the ball drop for a longer amount of time before stopping. We could also use a ticker tape timer with a faster period for more data points, and thus, a more accurate regression. These improvements would also minimize error.
