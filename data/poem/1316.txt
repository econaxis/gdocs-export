One Death for a Man, a Thousand Tears for a Child
So many wars,
So many wounds.


So many deaths,
With so little purpose.


Counted in millions,
Are the deaths of men.
But counted in infinites,
Are the tears of a child.


I dreamt of him,
Up, from above the clouds,
And down, below the trenches.


I would sleep dreaming of him.
“Where would I meet him?,
Would he be strong enough to carry me?,
Am I taller than him?”


When she pulled me out of class,
The questions changed.
“How many tears could the body hold?,
When would I stop crying.”
I tasted a lot of salt that day.


My father’s death was commemorated.
But the death inside me,
Passed silently.

Poetic Devices:
* Alliteration/Repetition (Lines 1-4)
* Symbolism: The father takes part in everything the boy has done in this world, and when the father dies, the boy feels the effects.
* Rhetorical questions: They convey the boy’s thoughts and childish manner without it being a direct monologue of him reciting his emotions to the speaker. 
* Foreshadowing: Stanza 3 foreshadows a death, which would later happen in Stanza 6.


Brief analysis:


	Ocean
Someone, always around
Sometimes, so calm, smooth, soothing.
Other times, crashing and thundering.


In the lulls of the night, 
stomping the shore with your feet,
And in the light of the day, 
pounding the sand with your surf.


You are deeper than we know.
Merely a superhero, but in disguise.
Underneath your somber waves,
Are things no human grasps.
Something so powerful,
Used as a dumping place.


So vast,
But not vastly understood.
So kind, forgiving,
Yet exploited without mercy.


I heard you were 70% of this world,
But I have only seen 1% of you.

Brief analysis:
	Dancing Death
First, it danced around the trees. 
We all knew—but what could we do?
The next day, it came closer.
We watched its dance through his eyes.


The clock ticked,
The alarm ringed,
The sun went up, and down,
And Death came closer.


We waited.
Tried to talk, held hands.
Argued, cried.
And Death came closer.


When we all pretended to sleep,
When the tick, tock of the clock seemed so loud.
When we tried so hard to not think about death,
That’s when Death knocked.


We stormed down to confront it,
face to face with dancing Death.
We glared at it, but couldn’t.
It was his face that we were staring at.


Death danced around his limp body.
And left.


Nature changed.
The body looked the same,
But nature changed.


We cleaned up Death’s leftovers.
And watched Death dance away,
To its next victim.
