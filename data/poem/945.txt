Ocean
Someone, always around


Sometimes, so calm, smooth, soothing.
Other times, 
In the lulls of the night, 
stomping the shore with your feet,
And in the light of the day, 
pounding the sand with your surf.


You are deeper than we know.
Merely a superhero, but in disguise.
Underneath your somber waves,
Are things no human grasps.
Something so powerful,
Used as a dumping place.


So vast,
But not vastly understood.
So kind, forgiving,
Yet exploited without mercy.


I heard you were 70% of this world,
But I have only seen 1% of you.
























One Death for a Man, a Thousand Tears for a Child
So many wars,
So many wounds.


So many deaths,
With so little purpose.


Counted in millions,
Are the deaths of men.
But counted in infinites,
Are the tears of a child.


I dreamt of him,
Up, from above the clouds,
And down, below the trenches.


I would sleep dreaming of him.
“Where would I meet him?,
Would he be strong enough to carry me?,
Am I taller than him?”


When she pulled me out of class,
The questions changed.
“How many tears did the body hold?,
When would I stop crying.”


My father’s death was commemorated.
But the death inside me,
Passed silently.



































Dancing Death
First, it danced around the trees. 
We all knew—but what could we do?
The next day, it came closer.
We watched its dance through his eyes.


The clock ticked,
The alarm ringed,
The sun went up, and down,
And Death came closer.


We waited.
Tried to talk, held hands.
Argued, cried.
And Death came closer.


When we all pretended to sleep,
When the tick, tock of the clock seemed so loud.
When we tried so hard to not think about death,
That’s when Death knocked.


We stormed down to confront it,
face to face with dancing Death.
We glared at it, but couldn’t.
It was his face that we were staring at.


Death danced around his limp body.
And left.


Nature was different after.
Though the body looked about the same,
Everything was different.


We cleaned up Death’s leftovers.
And watched Death dance away,
To its next victim.
