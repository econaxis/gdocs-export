There was this young boy in a kindergarten class in Vietnam, and he was not the smiling, cute, obedient children that most parents would have dreamed for. He was a troublemaker. He didn’t sit down when the teachers told him to. He didn’t eat lunch when he was supposed to. He didn’t listen and remember instructions. Every morning, the poor people subjected to the job of waking this boy faced a miniature wrestler, armed with his fists, nails, and teeth. These poor people were usually his parents. This teacher had a surprising amount of patience for this boy. The boy had been expelled  4 other teachers on the second day before his parents had settled on this one. It had been 5 days without a note home so far: a new record. On this sixth day, however, the boy was feeling particularly adventurous. 
He hadn’t known how far the limits of of the teacher’s patience went up to, and this day would be the day to see.
