There was this young boy in a kindergarten class in Vietnam, and he was not the smiling, cute, obedient children that most parents would have dreamed for. He was a troublemaker. He didn’t sit down when the teachers told him to. He didn’t eat lunch when he was supposed to. He didn’t listen and remember instructions. Every morning, the poor people subjected to the job of waking this boy faced a miniature wrestler, armed with his fists, nails, and teeth. These poor people were usually his parents. On the sixth day of his 4th kindergarten center, this boy was feeling particularly lousy. This lousiness caused the whole class to stand, hands behind head and face against the wall, as a punishment. The boy was even madder this time. “What is the point of this?” he dropped his hands and faced the teacher, “This is so stupid. Why can’t we do the fun stuff, like going home?” The whole class was silent. It seemed as if all of the teacher’s built up anger against the boy came flowing out. She led him by the hand towards the back, as the rest of the class strained their eyes, but locked their heads, to see what was happening. She put this boy in a small room, lit by white monotone fluorescent lights on a white ceiling. The teacher promptly shut the door and left the room to attend to her other students. The boy was alone, now. That boy was me.


        I had lived through Vietnam’s harsh education system for the first 6 years of my life, before immigrating to Canada. The true story above reflects very well the highlights of the things I learned with the Vietnamese education system: to shut up, and to blindly follow.
