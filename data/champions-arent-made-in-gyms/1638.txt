“Champions aren’t made in gyms. Champions are made from something they have deep inside them: a desire, a dream, a vision. They have to have last-minute stamina, they have to be a little faster, they have to have the skill and the will. But the will must be stronger than the skill” - Muhammad Ali. 
In my opinion, being successful in every aspect of life requires hard work, skill, and practice. This rule applies to everything in life, regardless of what  you pursue or your personality. Although many people have reached perfection without all three of those components, they are very rare and special. However, there is another important factor in determining the success a person has when pursuing something:motivation. Without motivation, a person with extraordinary talent in a field but no motivation to transform that talent into skill is not successful at all.
        For example, during my first years of life, I often loathed math, I hated it more than any other subject. However, what I did not realize, was that math will be field in which I have so much talent and skill in. Ignoring my pleads and excuses, my father kept on pushing me to do more math and utilize that talent of my to the greatest potential. The years dragged by, and now, I am the top mathematics student in my class! If my dad had not developed my talent in mathematics, I would not have realized it, and the talent would wither away. 
        The talent is just a seed, a beginning, we have to develop it for it to grow into something more usable and skillful. Without care and hard-work, the seed will not be useful at all. Therefore, even if we have a lot of talent, it would still be worthless if we don’t nurture the talent to transform it into skill. This requires a lot of motivation. You can only use the talent to its full potential if you have motivation to nurture it as you go along.
