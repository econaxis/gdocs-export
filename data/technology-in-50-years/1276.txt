Technology has evolved over the decades, an example is the earliest room-sized cameras to the compact, rugged and waterproof GoPros today. Many technological tools have helped us in our everyday lives, from preserving wonderful memories to crunching numbers with Microsoft’s Excel. IN addition, had drives and flash drives will get more compact and will be able to stroe more data. Many people say this is unnecesary because no one needs to store that much data, except maybe large companies or lawyers. However, as the capacity increases, the code becomes more complicated, allowing developers to write richer and more functional programs. Early, when there were huge, bulky, and slow computers, 5 kilobytes, equivalent to about half a second of video, that’s how much it is.
