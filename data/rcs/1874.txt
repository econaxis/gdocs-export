1: The road to a safer future
The road to a safer future is not multiple roads that each nation can look towards and pursue on their own merit. Similarly, the road to a safer future is not a road in which we can enter at any time, although it is a road in which we can fall off it at any time. The road to a safer future is also not one that we, as a unified species, can pursue on a whim, but decide then 5 weeks later that “more important problems” need to be solved or “we are out of budget.” 


It would be hard to call this road a “road”—rather, it is more of a precarious ridge. Besides this ridge, if we fail to stay on this ever thinner ridge, are all the consequences third-world countries are all too familiar with: hunger, floods, droughts, and overall, not a safer future. 


Just from a quick glance at the current situation and at any newspaper front page reveals how far we are from this ridge, and while the inevitable consequences that lie are a horizon’s away, we must work quickly to get onto this ridge, that is a safer future. 


The road to a safer future must be traversed for the biggest of obstacles like corporate resistance and budgeting, and we must avoid common excuses to bypass these obstacles and chase short-term elections. Thus, with all the current government malaise, we cannot expect to reliably stay on this ridge for more than 5 months straight. 


However, we must act fast. The ridge is thinning for every moment that we participate in environmental destruction. If we hesitate too much and dwell too long on petty human issues, this ridge will no longer exist. By then, no matter how many resources we have or how determined and effective governments will be, there will no longer be a road to a safer future. We must enter this ridge before it runs out. 


___________________________________________________


* Everywhere on the news, the road to a safer future, the road to a safer future, the road to a safer future. 
   * Yet, no one knows the definitive road to a safer future—does it involve renewables or nuclear? Does it require higher investment on education or more financial aid available to students? We don’t seem to know.
* When one nation looks left for the road to a safer future, another looks right; when one looks one way upon an issue, the other looks the other way. We can’t seem to decide upon which road to take. Even when leaders have convened regarding climate change in Paris for weeks straight, they had all left thinking different thoughts, many of them still figuring out how to dodge the promises they had made. 


While the biggest obstacle towards a safer future is indeed fixing the environment, we have strayed so far and so long without recognizing the impacts of our actions, such that this supposed road is no longer a road—rather, it is a ridge. It is a ridge with steep sloping sides that lead toward the consequences third-world countries are all to aware of: hunger, violence, floods, droughts, and more. Getting on this ridge is hard, and staying on it through all of its depressions (wc) and bumps will require much more dedication from the government than today. We must stay on this ridge no matter how much money will tempt us to get off this ridge, because once we get off, we can’t get back on. 


For now, the way to a safer future is still a narrow road that stretches all the way to the short horizon that the eye can see. But if we keep ignoring the inevitable, and keep on chasing short, monetary temptations which lead us nowhere to the thinning road to a safer future, then it will be harder and harder. 


A global collective, not different from the Paris Climate Conference will help us align towards the ridge that will lead us to a safer future. That is the first step. But we cannot just walk away facing whatever the closest monetary temptation is—as had happened with the previous Conference. 


What should be different?
