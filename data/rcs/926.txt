1: The road to a safer future
The road to a safer future is not multiple roads that each nation can look towards and pursue on their own merit. Similarly, the road to a safer future is not a road in which we can enter at any time, although it is a road in which we can fall off it at any time. The road to a safer future is also not one that we, as a unified species, can pursue on a whim, but decide then 5 weeks later that “more important problems” need to be solved or “we are out of budget.” 


It would be hard to call this road a “road”—rather, it is more of a precarious ridge. Besides this ridge, if we fail to stay on this ever thinner ridge, are all the consequences third-world countries are all too familiar with: hunger, floods, droughts, and overall, not a safer future. 


Just from a quick glance at the current situation and at any newspaper front page reveals how far we are from this ridge, and while the inevitable consequences that lie are a horizon’s away, we must work quickly to get onto this ridge, that is a safer future. 


The road to a safer future must be traversed for the biggest of obstacles like corporate resistance and budgeting, and we must avoid common excuses to bypass these obstacles and chase short-term elections. Thus, with all the current government malaise, we cannot expect to reliably stay on this ridge for more than 5 months straight. 


However, we must act fast. The ridge is thinning for every moment that we participate in environmental destruction. If we hesitate too much and dwell too long on petty human issues, this ridge will no longer exist. By then, no matter how many resources we have or how determined and effective governments will be, there will no longer be a road to a safer future. We must enter this ridge before it runs out.
