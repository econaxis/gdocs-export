People make mistakes many times in their life, including me. It is impossible to not make mistakes in
your life, you have to, and mistakes are your steps to success. Why? Because when you make mistakes, 
you realize it and you try not to do the mistake again. But if you do not make mistakes, then you will 
not likely to realize what is wrong as easily as the other person who does make mistakes. However, in 
some circumstances, making mistakes are really bad, such as making a mistake when landing an air 
plane, that could do incredible damage to not only the runway and the airport, but to the passengers on 
that plane as well. Today, I am going to tell you a time that I made a mistake that haunts me forever.


A few years ago, I made someone with mental disorders cry so badly that I felt sorry for her. What I 
did that made her cry was throwing pieces of paper into her desk! As I said, she is a mental illness, so 
her brain reacts differently to various situations, such as the one that I put her in.
