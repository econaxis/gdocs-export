Utopia by More is an account of a discussion between three people highly interested in philosophy and politics about a fictional place named Utopia. Deemed as the perfect place, a utopia, by Raphael Hyt, the three discuss all aspects of Utopia, from slaves to marriage to their professions. 


All of the ideas put forth by Hyt about the manner of life of the people of Utopia seem perfect and logical upon first glance—for example, that “every man has some peculiar trade to which he applies himself,” or the fact that one may change the trade that he is born to if he is naturally inclined to work in a different field. Upon closer inspection, however, these ideas seem a little bit simplistic and ignorant of basic human nature—that some day, one of these “golden citizens” would figure out a way to exploit the system for his own good. Others would then follow, and the only way to keep the perfect Utopia is to instate strict rules, by then it would no longer be a Utopia, but rather a dictatorship.


These excerpts’ ideologies are in line with socialist ideologies, and could be thought of as the early experiments of a socialist Utopia. Of course, as we now know, socialism brings along with it many other problems, primarily associated with the tendency for human nature to exploit what they are given, that had not been known at that time. 


Perhaps, the fact that More was a deeply religious and moral man bound him to the good side of human nature and prevented him from the ways his Utopia would break down. Perhaps, this was the government More had envisioned when controlled entirely by philosophers, as Plato had suggested. All in all, Utopia is one man’s dreams about a perfect government without any regard of the complexities and tendencies of human nature that prevents such a world from existing for long.
