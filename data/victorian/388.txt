Victorians made mourning jewelry out of their loved or deceased’s hair and teeth.


Queen Victoria slept with a cast of her dead husband's hand


People didn’t smile in Victorian era photos because each photo took 10 minutes and smiling for that long of time would be tiring.


“Hysteria” was an actual diagnosis for many symptoms associated with normal female reproductive traits. Sexual desire, insomnia, and faintness were common symptoms for female hysteria. Treatment would involve a doctor-induced orgasm, or “paroxysms,” as women were believed to lack sexual desire. After supposed “treatment,” women claimed to have been relieved of all of their previous symptoms. Physician fatigue and cramped fingers soon led to the invention of a machine that would do the doctor’s job of massaging the clitoris—a vibrator.


Queen Victoria disliked feminists even though she was a woman herself. She had even wrote that “Lady Amberly [a British suffragist] ought to get a good whipping.” Her authority rested entirely on her status as a “proper” woman and a queen. Deviating from this accepted groove for women was dangerous for Queen Victoria who did not have a male husband to back her. Therefore, establishing herself as a feminine and proper Queen figure first, then ruling Britain second.
