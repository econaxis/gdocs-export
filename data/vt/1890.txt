* Seeing the old man with the broom
* The deaf man who would motion us to help him with laundry. 
   * I was confused, but my cousin helped willingly, almost as if he was a member of the house.
   * I could only watch and struggled with the laundry, but my cousin willingly helped with the laundry, quick as ever
   * Afterwards, when I asked him if he knew the man, he said no. That sent a million questions to my head: how could he act so natural and did the laundry like it was his own for a man whom he didn’t know and was deaf.
* Tying the baby roller to the bike and pushing it down the street
* The drunk men, wearing stained white undershirts and playing some sort of Vietnamese card game.




In the midday, my mom and my aunts would come home with fresh meat and food from the nearby market. Their motorcycles would run through the narrow halls, and occasionally, would just slide near one of the food stands that featured all sorts of watermelon, coconut, and jackfruit
. 
But that wasn’t always the highlight of my trips to the makeshift outdoor market. Sometimes, there would be old women battering their old men for being too lazy, or too drunk, or any crazy combination of those 2. There would be old men playing some sort of card game on broken pieces of wood from the nearby construction site, laughing and drinking and shouting. 


I was never once part of those communities. I had always stood as an outsider, and even though I was Vietnamese at heart and had spent the first half of my life in Vietnam, I could never relate to these specific Vietnamese identities: playing cards and drinking at 10 AM in the morning, or going for morning stroll to buy street food priced at less than $1. 


And everytime my parents or anyone else question me, that what is it that makes me love Vietnam so much. They couldn’t understand it, and they had good reasons for not understanding. I had left Vietnam at the young age of 6, barely knowing any Vietnamese or why my parents were so adamant on immigrating to a foreign country. To me, Vietnam was my world, and I had nothing to compare my world against. 


Only looking back, I could identify this weird feeling, similar to nostalgia, whenever I hopped onto the front seat of the motorcycle: crawling under my dad’s arms and scooching down. By now, I have grown too old and too tall to be able to sit at the front of the motorcycle anymore, but the feeling of flying through the streets and past the street side vendors, was always amazing. Except, of course, when we sat in the blistering sun stuck in a traffic jam between trucks and trailers.

One day, I came across a black and white picture of an old man doing laundry. Underneath, was titled “The Top 10 Pictures That Best Describe Vietnam,” as usual in the Facebook post style. I knew it was clickbait and all the pictures would disappoint me, from my past experience with these posts, but I still couldn’t help but click it. Why was this old man featured on the thumbnail of a Facebook article?

* One day, came to Vietnam, and came across the same old man. (One week later after seeing the article on Facebook)
* Suddenly associated him to the one I saw on Facebook. As I didn’t want to be too much of a stalker. I stole glances at the man’s face, but unfortunately, the more I looked at him, the more he had resembled the person I had seen last week on Facebook. 
* I made sure to remember the area in which he hung out, and promptly went to dinner in the back of the house. I would search up for the Facebook post tomorrow, to see if I was really seeing what I thought I was seeing.
