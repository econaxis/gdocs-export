One day, I came across a black and white picture of an old man doing laundry. Underneath, there was a post dubbed “The Top 10 Pictures That Best Describe Vietnam,” as usual in the Facebook post style. I knew it was clickbait and all the pictures would disappoint me, from my past experience with these posts, but I still couldn’t help but click it. Why was this old man featured on the thumbnail of a Facebook article?


It didn’t bother my mind for at least a few weeks, until I saw him again, besides an old alleyway, doing his laundry. I wasn’t totally sure, the first time I glanced at him while biking past him, that he was really the man I saw on Facebook.

You know the close-up portraits of old people used as pictures for Facebook posts, titled something similar to “How the Poorest in Third World Countries Live,” or “Top 10 Pictures You Won’t Believe About Vietnam/Afghanistan/Syria/insert any third world country?” That old man, with wrinkled face and distant eyes with a slightly out of focus background and a black and white filter—you have seen him. For all of us Westerners know, his face is 


* One day, came to Vietnam, and came across the same old man. (One week later after seeing the article on Facebook)
* Suddenly associated him to the one I saw on Facebook. As I didn’t want to be too much of a stalker. I stole glances at the man’s face, but unfortunately, the more I looked at him, the more he had resembled the person I had seen last week on Facebook. 
* I made sure to remember the area in which he hung out, and promptly went to dinner in the back of the house. I would search up for the Facebook post tomorrow, to see if I was really seeing what I thought I was seeing. 
* Couldn’t look for the article again, scrolled down as far as my facebook feed would go, but still, that black and white picture was nowhere to be found. 
* I searched up all the terms I could: The Top 10 Vietnamese People, The Top 10 Pictures About Vietnam, Black and White Pictures of Vietnam. None yielded what I was looking for.
* I promptly forgot about the man, but when I lay restless in the hot Vietnam night, my head kept popping back to that old man. Was it really him?
* To be clear, the old man I saw on Facebook was more a symbol of the crumbling poverty in Vietnam and other third-world countries, rather than a personal figure. He was one of many: search up any of the terms “Vietnam” or “poor,” and you are destined to find the same old man, in the usual black and white filter, as if black and white somehow emphasizes that they are poor.


When I had crossed his house on my bike, he motioned me and my cousin over, with some gibberish that I could barely understand. I looked over at my cousin, confused, but already, he parked his bicycle at the street-side (there was no sidewalk) and was walking towards the old man. I watched to see what he would do, still sitting lopsided on my bike. I briefly noticed that he was the same man I saw yesterday, and looked exactly like the pictures of supposed “poor” people online. 


I didn’t have much time to process after that as my cousin ushered me off of my bike. I was more confused than ever now. How did my cousin know this old man who couldn’t speak even proper Vietnamese. Remarkably, without any further sounds coming from the man, my cousin started for the hangers stacked on a hook and hung his laundry. I was flabbergasted! What kind of person goes and does an old man’s laundry without asking him! 


I sheepishly helped my cousin, only by handing him the hangers. I never dared to touch the old man’s wet clothes, for reasons I didn’t know. It was just too weird. 


Nevertheless, that encounter changed my view on the man, and all the other men who had their faces reduced by black and white filters for the world to see. The experience brought some realism to my thoughts about these men: they are everywhere. In the shopping malls, the sidewalks, and all around Downtown. They weren’t some exotic fruit like the durian or the dragonfruit, yet, we treat them like exotic symbols of third-world corruption, and feel good that we live in such a privileged country. But these men are everywhere. We don’t see them because we barely pay any attention to the creases on their frowns, the tattered clothes they wear, nor do we ever get a close up on their black and white faces. They are everywhere. Just pay attention.

Seeing the old man with the broom
The deaf man who would motion us to help him with laundry. 
I was confused, but my cousin helped willingly, almost as if he was a member of the house.
I could only watch and struggled with the laundry, but my cousin willingly helped with the laundry, quick as ever
Afterwards, when I asked him if he knew the man, he said no. That sent a million questions to my head: how could he act so natural and did the laundry like it was his own for a man whom he didn’t know and was deaf.
Tying the baby roller to the bike and pushing it down the street
The drunk men, wearing stained white undershirts and playing some sort of Vietnamese card game.




In the midday, my mom and my aunts would come home with fresh meat and food from the nearby market. Their motorcycles would run through the narrow halls, and occasionally, would just slide near one of the food stands that featured all sorts of watermelon, coconut, and jackfruit
. 
But that wasn’t always the highlight of my trips to the makeshift outdoor market. Sometimes, there would be old women battering their old men for being too lazy, or too drunk, or any crazy combination of those 2. There would be old men playing some sort of card game on broken pieces of wood from the nearby construction site, laughing and drinking and shouting. 


I was never once part of those communities. I had always stood as an outsider, and even though I was Vietnamese at heart and had spent the first half of my life in Vietnam, I could never relate to these specific Vietnamese identities: playing cards and drinking at 10 AM in the morning, or going for morning stroll to buy street food priced at less than $1. 


And everytime my parents or anyone else question me, that what is it that makes me love
