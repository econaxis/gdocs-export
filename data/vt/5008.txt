He was always there: sitting on a makeshift piece of wood, and watching us through half-closed eyes. As a kid, I’d often wondered how he could sit in the sun so long and not get uncomfortable. Perhaps, that was why his face and skin was so tanned and tattered. Occasionally, I’d get a break from his stare as people came to him to fix their bikes and motorbikes. Usually, it was something simple like repairing a tire, and after, he would turn back to looking at us. I was 6 at the time, and my feelings on the man didn’t extend far past uncomfortable.


When I went back to Vietnam for a month for a vacation, the same old man sat there, on the same, but slightly darker piece of wood, watching us. Behind him, still, was a multitude of makeshift bicycle repair equipment, dirtied by the beating equatorial sun and blast of endless motorcycle engines. Whenever I got the chance to run by the old man, I’d steal a glance at his aging face, until I could no longer. There was some barrier that prevented me from talking to him, despite how much I wanted to talk to him. It was built almost as if the years I had spent in my childhood ignoring the man who was staring at me slowly built up this talking barrier between me and the man. But in the end, I reassured myself that he was just a bike mechanic, and it didn’t matter whether I talked to him or not. 


It was until then, that I realized that I would have to live with him for the last 2 weeks of my vacation, because my parents were going on an “adults-only” trip with their past friends. I assumed that I would live with someone that I knew, not the neighboring bike mechanic who had spent most of his years watching me play soccer. 


I was livid. I came to Vietnam for a vacation, not to be working for some random old man I didn’t know. But still, my parents insisted on having me 
[a]One day, I came across a black and white picture of an old man doing laundry. Underneath, there was a post dubbed “The Top 10 Pictures That Best Describe Vietnam,” as usual in the Facebook post style. I knew it was clickbait and all the pictures would disappoint me, from my past experience with these posts, but I still couldn’t help but click it. Why was this old man featured on the thumbnail of a Facebook article?


It didn’t bother my mind for at least a few weeks, until I saw him again, besides an old alleyway, doing his laundry. I wasn’t totally sure, the first time I glanced at him while biking past him, that he was really the man I saw on Facebook.

You know the close-up portraits of old people used as pictures for Facebook posts, titled something similar to “The Poorest 10 Countries in the World!” or “Top 10 Pictures You Won’t Believe About Vietnam/Afghanistan/Syria/insert any third world country?” That old man, with wrinkled face and distant eyes with a slightly out of focus background and a black and white filter—you have seen him. For all of us Westerners, when we see his face, we immediately proclaim our compassion with a flurry of Facebook likes, and, for the more “compassionate ones,” leave a few heartfelt comments on the post. I was one of those people: who would like and move on to the next post, with a small sense of pride that I somehow had done some good to the world. That was, until I saw the man I had seen on Facebook in a small brick house besides an alleyway in Vietnam.


It wasn’t that I was actively looking for the “man I saw on Facebook,” rather, just seeing him sweep the sidewalk beside his house with a broken broomstick reminded me of the man I saw on Facebook. There were no distinguishable features of both men: all I could say were that they looked like poor old men, except the one I saw on Facebook was more clad in black and white. 


Over time, I got to know him more and more. His children studied north, at the Vietnam National University in Hanoi. His wife usua

Seeing the old man with the broom
The deaf man who would motion us to help him with laundry. 
I was confused, but my cousin helped willingly, almost as if he was a member of the house.
I could only watch and struggled with the laundry, but my cousin willingly helped with the laundry, quick as ever
Afterwards, when I asked him if he knew the man, he said no. That sent a million questions to my head: how could he act so natural and did the laundry like it was his own for a man whom he didn’t know and was deaf.
Tying the baby roller to the bike and pushing it down the street
The drunk men, wearing stained white undershirts and playing some sort of Vietnamese card game.




In the midday, my mom and my aunts would come home with fresh meat and food from the nearby market. Their motorcycles would run through the narrow halls, and occasionally, would just slide near one of the food stands that featured all sorts of watermelon, coconut, and jackfruit
. 
But that wasn’t always the highlight of my trips to the makeshift outdoor market. Sometimes, there would be old women battering their old men for being too lazy, or too drunk, or any crazy combination of those 2. There would be old men playing some sort of card game on broken pieces of wood from the nearby construction site, laughing and drinking and shouting. 


I was never once part of those communities. I had always stood as an outsider, and even though I was Vietnamese at heart and had spent the first half of my life in Vietnam, I could never relate to these specific Vietnamese identities: playing cards and drinking at 10 AM in the morning, or going for morning stroll to buy street food priced at less than $1. 


And everytime my parents or anyone else question me, that what is it that makes me love
