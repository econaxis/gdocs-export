Life is full of growth. In my opinion, we cannot properly live life without growing in our abilities. If we don’t grow, then we are just going to stay the same throughout our whole life, but as I said before, life is nothing if we don’t continue growing. Life is also about growth for all of the institutions or groups that we are in, such as our family, our city, our country, or our company, life is about growing and becoming better every day. In addition, no one can voluntarily stop themselves from growing, it is a natural part of our body, our brain, our mind, and our soul to grow and become better. The struggles that we have to overcome and the successes that we fret over define our life and our personalities.
        As humans, we have a better and harder responsibility than just to eat, drink, then sleep. We have the responsibility to improve upon ourselves, to seek challenges. We cannot be happy from just staying where we currently are and being fine with it. That is not happiness. Happiness is finding something new, something undiscovered that we have not tried before, something that makes us better as human beings. We cannot also be productive at all by not growing and staying the same throughout our whole life. Being productive is being able to produce large amounts of work in the least amount of time, so without growing in our ability to do things, we cannot be continually productive. 
        Growing is also very important to not just we human beings as individuals, but also as large groups of people, institutions. Many of the qualities and advantages of growing from individuals also apply to institutions greatly, such as being more productive and the inability to voluntarily stop growing. 
        We as humans embrace growth and improvement, so it is the most important factor in determining a person’s happiness. We cannot do much without growing, and we cannot be productive and happy without growing .
