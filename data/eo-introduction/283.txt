I am a white-collar finance analyst working for UBC, nearing 50 years old. And yes: I had also considered the absurdity of a middle-aged man, working in a field that has nothing to do with writing, sign up for a 10 week writing course. I had always had thoughts brewing in my head, from ideas for a story to the worst pranks for my son, but I never knew how to get them out, on paper or on the computer screen. I wanted to see them in a tangible form, to be able to say that I was “officially done” with the idea. 
I suspect that the strict 5 paragraph essay format from 7th grade had stuck on till now, and having no introduction, or topic sentence, or thesis meant that I couldn’t write an essay. I knew that was also true: I hadn’t written an essay in my college years.
