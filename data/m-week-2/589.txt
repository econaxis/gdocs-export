3. A Fish Market in Vietnam


The muddled puddles strewn across the dirty and stained asphalt of the fish market reflected all the faces and carts and fish and boxes all moving around. First, near the edge of the dirty puddle and the asphalt, the faces would appear distorted—one could barely recognize it was a face. Until, the fisherman or the shopkeeper or the cashier would walk just a little further and appear in the middle of the reflection on the puddle. Unaware, of course, the someone was watching them through the muddled reflection of the water. Once they walked a little further, and neared the end of the puddle, their faces would morph once again and disappear into the asphalt. Dozens, and soon hundreds of men and women and shopkeepers and running children and rolling carts would follow the same procession, until when an unknowing man stepped on the puddle. That was the end of the puddle.


But it certainly wasn’t the end for all the other people in the fish market. The cashiers and their machines still operated with surprising speed, the weights and scales straining to bear the weight of the fish, and the occasional few out-of-place tourists who were also there to observe this madness. The smell of fresh fish pervaded the entire area, supplemented by the occasional yell as a fish somehow flopped its way onto the tourists. And within all of this madness, lies a puddle that has yet to be disturbed.
