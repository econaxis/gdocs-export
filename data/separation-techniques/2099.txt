Density separation separates components based on their different densities. Usually, the mixture is submerged in a liquid of appropriate density in a separatory funnel. Denser components will be near the bottom whereas lighter components will be near the top. 
	Froth floatation uses chemicals that adhere to specific components in a mixture and make it buoyant in the solvent. Components that do not adhere to the chemicals remain in the solvent and become separated from those who have adhered to the chemical.
	Distillation separates liquid mixtures by their volatility, or vapor pressures. The vapour phase of the mixture will be richer in the lowest boiling point component, which can be condensed into a separate beaker. Further distillations will result in a richer and richer mixture of the most volatile component. 
	Electrophoresis is a form of chromatography in which components are separated based on their attraction to a constant applied electric field. Size, polarity, and charge of the components are all factors in the speed that they move through the stationary phase. Different speeds of movement translate to separation of the components.
	Centrifugation uses the different inertial forces of different components in a mixture to separate them. The one with more inertia (more mass) will fall outwards as the centrifuge rotates at a high frequency. Thus, heavier components will be at the end of the centrifuge tube while lighter components will be near the opening.
	Recrystallization uses the lowered solubility of any solute in a given solvent when cooled. When a heated, saturated solution is cooled, the solutes will crystallize out of solution because of the decreased solubility. Crystallization of solutes will also remove any impurities in the solvent, thus leaving behind the solvent and crystals. The crystals can be filtered using gravity filtration.
